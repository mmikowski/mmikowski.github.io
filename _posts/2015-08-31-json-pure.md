title: Replace RESTful APIs with JSON-Pure
---
*Using JSON and WebSockets*

![JSON-Pure APIs](/images/2015-08-31-json-pure.png)

### How did we get here?
[RESTful APIs, the big lie](/the_lie) challenged the widely-held belief
that **RESTful APIs** are a good idea for modern web applications.
The inspiration to write the post came from two sources. First, we
were writing an new API for an SPA, so the topic was certainly at the top of
my mind.  Second, we are recruiting development team members, and the
candidates placed a surprising amount of importance on **RESTful APIs**.

#### And now the big sequel
The goal of [the big lie](/the_lie) therefore was to provide an objective,
easy to read, and well-ordered list of issues with **RESTful APIs**.
In other words, the goal was to clearly define the problem before
suggesting a solution.

This "big sequel" continues where [the big lie](/the_lie) ended and looks at some
best API practices when freed from the constraints of REST. However, before we do
let's clear up a big misconception many readers had about the original post.

#### REST is good
**REST** is going to be around for a long time. It works very well for
content delivery and we have an excellent and expensive infrastructure built around it.
I've never disputed this.  The original post, for example, contains this sentence:

> **REST** is a great mechanism for many things such as content delivery, and it
> has served us well for two decades.

But I had made a mistake in the original post: I
had titled it  **REST, the big lie** instead of **RESTful APIs, the big lie**.
I recognized the original title was too broad, but by the time I had fixed it
a few hours later the damage had been done: search engines, links,
and the social networks kept the original name.  And, as they say, you
can't uncook an egg. This title misled many people to think the article was
condeming all of **REST**.  So let me be clear: **REST** is essential and good.
And **RESTful APIs** are much less so.

#### RESTful APIs, not so much
The **big lie** about **RESTful APIs** is the commonly held belief that
they are almost always the best choice for web application APIs.  In truth, they
are particularly ill-suited for modern web applications like SPAs.
Most of issues are detailed in the [the big lie](/the_lie), and we are not going
to rehash them here.

Now, let's get to the good stuff.

### JSON-Pure best practices
[RESTful APIs, the big lie](/the_lie) concluded with a list of best-practices
that evolved over 8 years of developing non-RESTful APIs for commercial
[Single Page web Applications](http://www.amazon.com/Single-Page-Applications-end---end/dp/1617290750).
**JSON-Pure APIs** - a name I **made up** simply for _brevity and convenience_ -
follow these conventions.  There isn't an official standard or an Internet Engineering Task Force project for **JSON-Pure APIs**.  At least not yet.

Below are my recommendations **JSON-Pure APIs**.  The primary goal is to provide the best possible user experience for modern SPAs. Certainly the practices shown below are nothing new or revolutionary. You will see echoes of SOAP, JSON RPC, JSON API, JSend, JSON LD and Hydra in the recommendations - and probably a few other dozen standards I somehow missed.

- Use WebSockets and JSON
- Use an existing vocabulary
- Use four message types
- Use asynchronous transactions
- Use a reliable request
- Separate the request from the transport
- Use a reliable response
- Make it easy to debug
- Make it portable

This list is just slightly expanded from the summary of [the big lie](/the_lie).
Let's look at each in detail, starting from the top.

### Use Websockets and JSON
We recommend using the WebSockets transport with the JSON data exchange format.

#### WebSockets
The WebSockets transport begins as an HTTP/S request which is then upgraded by
the client and server to a WebSocket connection.  This means it generally passes
through firewalls as well as HTTP/S, yet it provides truly asynchronous, full-duplex,
persistent messaging channel between client and server with
[just a few bytes](http://blog.arungupta.me/rest-vs-websocket-comparison-benchmarks/)
of overhead per message.  Compare this to HTTP/S, where each message can require
multiple kilobytes of overhead thanks to verbose headers and cookies.
As a result, WebSockets not only provides great new capabilities, it can
also be 4-10x faster.

Prior to WebSockets, real-time messaging between a browser and a server was expensive
and error-prone.  I spent some quality time with XMPP, BOSH, and Strophe.  Trust me, it's
extremely painful in comparison.

Are WebSockets always required? Of course not. But the transport is easy to implement
on modern browsers and its capabilities are extremely compelling for SPAs.
APIs transported over WebSockets are **decidedly not RESTful** as there is only a
single `send()` method for transport, and there are no visible response codes in
web server logs.  And that's just fine.

#### JSON
JSON is a compelling data exchange format for web applications because JavaScript
provide very fast, safe methods to read and write the data.  That means that
at least on the browser client, we will be using `JSON.parse()` and
`JSON.stringify()` to parse and send the data respectively.  These very same methods are available on the server if we use Node.js; if not, there are robust JSON libraries for all other major web server platforms.

JSON is also the native format of many minimal-structure databases
such as MongoDB and CouchDB.  Even when it's not the native format, Node.js
interfaces to other databases such as PostgreSQL return query responses in
JSON.  This means
[marshalling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshalling_(computer_science))
data from a database to a client can have substantially lower overhead compared
ORMs such as Active Record (Ruby) or Hibernate (Java).

JSON does have its weaknesses compared other formats.  Most notably a JSON
document does not typically include a Document Type Declaration (DTD)
which is useful to ensure the message contents are valid. We have found that
that [JSON-Schema](http://json-schema.org/) addresses much of this deficit,
and is discussed further below.

Now let's look at using a clean, familiar vocabulary.

### Use an existing vocabulary
The best APIs use a vocabulary that is widely understood
with little nuance. This greatly reduces the cognitive overhead required
to read or write messages.

#### Action verbs
The [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)
vocabulary is very widely understood. We use a superset for our actions verbs.
Here they are organized by message type:

| Request  | Response                    | Confirmation       |
|----------|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| create   | CREATED or CREATE\_FAIL     | abort, done, retry |
| retrieve | RETRIEVED or RETRIEVE\_FAIL | abort, done, retry |
| update   | UPDATED or UPDATE\_FAIL     | abort, done, retry |
| delete   | DELETED or DELETE\_FAIL     | abort, done, retry |
| flush    | FLUSHED or FLUSH\_FAIL      | abort, done, retry |

Server response verbs are *directly* correlated with requests and are in
UPPERCASE to differentiat While at first this may appear almost trite, it
actually is quite important and useful, as we shall see when we discuss
*indirect responses* below.

We added the `flush` verb so the client can tell the server when it has
removed data from its storage.  Thus when the server distributes notification
of changed records, it doesn't have to send messages to clients that have
`flush`ed the containing record or data set.

#### Application status messages
Place all application status messages in a in a `log_table` (Update
2018-12-29: this used to be called `log_list` but I have since adopted the
convention of using `table` to indicate a list of objects or list of lists).
The JSON below shows all available log levels.  I have adjusted this to match
the [syslog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog) standard.

    { log_table: [
        { level_int : 0, level_str : "emerg", /* detail */ },
        { level_int : 1, level_str : "alert", ... },
        { level_int : 2, level_str : "crit",  ... },
        { level_int : 3, level_str : "error", ... },
        { level_int : 4, level_str : "warn",  ... },
        { level_int : 5, level_str : "notice",... },
        { level_int : 6, level_str : "info",  ... },
        { level_int : 7, level_str : "debug", ... },
      ],
      /* ... */
    }

    /* detail: log_id, code_key, code_str, user_msg */

The `level_int` value is useful to implement log filtering, either for the
recipient, or during a request.

Here is an example of a full error message:

    { log_table :[
        { code_key  : "400",
          code_str  : "Bad request",
          level_int : 3,
          level_str : "error",
          log_id    : "1096",
          user_msg  : "action_str required"
        }
      ],
      /* ... */
    }

Notice how we mapped a REST code to the error.  We do that for convenience and
familiarity.  However, we generally use the REST error codes as a subset of
our full vocabulary, since we can extend it as the application requires.

### Use four message types
SPA APIs generally require four message types:

1. Requests
2. Direct responses
3. Indirect responses
4. Confirmations

#### Requests
Requests are messages sent from clients requesting data manipulation or
delivery.  An example request to change a specific record would have the
`update` action verb.

#### Direct responses
Direct responses are messages from the server to attached clients directly in
response to a request. A direct response to the `update` request in the
example would use the `UPDATED` action verb.

#### Indirect responses
Indirect responses are sent from the server to clients without a direct
corresponding request.  This happens when the server needs to notify a client
of a data change, such as an updated, deleted, or new record. An indirect
response for the example above would have an `UPDATED` action verb.

#### Confirmations
Confirmations are sent from a client to a server to confirm a response has
been received **and processed**. The client may indicate success with `done`,
cancel the transaction with `abort`, or re-request the message with `retry`.
Generally it is a good idea to avoid the complexities of supporting the idea
of "partial success".

### Use a standard message structure
API messages should have a standard, minimal structure that is consistent and
easy to read.

#### Message formats
Here is a template of suggested JSON message formats for the request,
response, and confirm phases of a transaction:

    // request
    { action_str    : "retrieve",  /* action verb */
      data_type     : "person",    /* record data */
      log_table      : [ /* application messages   */ ],
      request_map   : { /* request parameters     */ },
      trans_map     : { /* transaction meta-data  */ }
    }

    // direct and indirect responses
    { action_str   : "RETRIEVED", /* action verb */
      data_type    : "person",    /* record data */
      log_table    : [ /* application messages   */ ],
      response_map : { /* returned data          */ },
      trans_map    : { /* transaction meta-data  */ }
    }

    // confirm
    { action_str  : "done",      /* action verb */
      data_type   : "person",    /* record data */
      log_table   : [ /* application messages   */ ],
      confirm_map : { /* confirmation details   */ },
      trans_map   : { /* transaction meta-data  */ }
    }

We have added a suffix to JSON keys to indicate type.  This greatly helps
the API consumer comprehend the meaning of fields at little cost.
Suggested suffixes are detailed in Appendix A
of [Single Page Web Applications](http://manning.com/mikowski) and a cheat
sheet is freely available [on GitHub](https://github.com/mmikowski/spa/blob/master/cheat-sheet.pdf).

#### Field meanings
- The action verb, `action_str`, is required. It is discussed above.
- The `data_type` indicator is application dependent.
- The application messages list, `log_table`, is optional. It is discussed
  above.
- The `request_map`, `response_map`, and `confirm_map` are required for each
  message type.
- The `trans_map` is required and includes transaction specific parameters.
  It is discussed below.

#### Message aggregation
Multiple messages may be aggregated by placing them in a list, for example:

    [ { /* message 1 */ },
      { /* message 2 */ },
      ....
    ]

Messages are processed in the order received. An API can get rather chatty
at times, so it can be a good idea to employ a strategy to aggregate messages
on both the client and the server. One approach is to employ a message queue
that is sent with a limited frequency.

#### Schema validation
We generally use a [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/) to validate
messages.  Validation isn't hard to implement, and it helps avoid silly and
gnarly errors that can occur with invalid messages.

### Use asynchronous transactions
We suggest using `request-response-confirm` for API transactions instead of
the REST `request-response` convention.  First, let's consider when
`request-response` is more appropriate.

#### Use request-response when appropriate
We want the classic `request-response` approach when the web browser is used
to display published content like this blog page. It is simple, clean,
and well-understood.  Any benefit of using a more complex transaction is
almost certainly outweighed by the costs.

#### Use request-response-confirm for APIs
SPAs, however, are better served by `request-response-confirm` transactions.
For example, if a client `requests` a resource, the server issues a `response`.
Once the client has received and _processed_ the response, it will send a
`confirm` to the server.

The benefits of the `request-response-confirm` transaction include:

- The confirmation goes beyond the _transport status_ -- was the message
  received? -- and reports to the server the _application status_ of the message
  -- was the message properly processed and consumed?  This is very important
  for an SPA so the server may keep track of client data sets.

- The transaction is asynchronous. The client, for example, may take 20
  seconds to consume a large data set; or perhaps the client may wait for
  user approval before processing or denying a provided data set.
  During this time, the server can continue to process other request while
  while awaiting the confirmation.  Implementing such a delay over a typical
  RESTful `request-response` cycle using something like BOSH can be difficult 
  and expensive.

The `request-response-confirm` cycle is therefore often the best option
if we need to sync records between a rich client and server.

### Use a reliable request
Don't embed any application meaning into the transport request.
Instead, use the single, most reliable request method available.

On the transport layer, we are simply concerned about whether an API message is
successfully transferred or not.  Think of the transport layer as the "delivery
driver" of web traffic: He will make sure our new sweater gets delivered
(transport issue), but he's not going to sit around for hours while we decide
if we like it or not (application issue) and want to send it back.

WebSockets provides only a single `send()` method for requests.
If we use HTTP for our API, it is wise to use only `POST` and ignore the other verbs.

### Separate the request from the transport
A typical RESTful API call splits the application-level meaning of a message
between the message body and the headers.  We wish to instead leave headers
alone and place all application-level details in the message.  We do this
through the `trans_map` and using a simple end point.

#### The transaction map
The transaction map, or `trans_map` was introduced earlier and contains
transaction specific fields.  Here is an example:

    trans_map  : {
      auth_key : "c76aa3577f8b5a60206f9d041c76034a3c1f",
      trans_id : "eb99ec08-7e90-400d-9585-62a1385ec158"
    }

The `trans_id` should be generated by the originator and should be immutable
throughout the transaction.  The `auth_key` will vary by implementation and
client.  A transaction may require additional details not shown here such as
a server time stamp,  but this is a good start.

#### The end point
Use an API endpoint that fully describes the API source and version. If using
HTTP, for example, and endpoint might look like the following:

    https://api.mycompany.com/3-1-a/

Better yet, put the API version (`api_version`) in the `trans_map` as that
make the API transport independent.

Send all directives through the `action_str` property.  Certainly, this
precludes any sort of caching that RESTful API fans will undoubtedly miss.
But the purpose of an an API is to communicate dynamic messages, not static
content.  Transfer of bulk data and caching can be done at many levels, and we
can leverage the good parts of HTTP and REST when we need to.  For example,
instead of delivering image data over our API, we can instead provide a URL to
a cache-able PNG image.

### Use a reliable response
Don't embed any application meaning into the transport response.  Instead, use
the single, most reliable response method available.  As with the request, we
are simply concerned about whether an API response is successfully transferred
or not.

A WebSockets transport doesn't allow us to impart meaning to a response.
Either the message is received or it fails.  If we use HTTP, then we should we
use a 200 OK response whenever the transport succeeds, and leave any
application-level communication to the message content.

### Make it easy to debug
Debugging **JSON-Pure APIs** is quite straight-forward.  First, we can check
if the message transport has succeeded.  Then we can proceed to inspect the
JSON for any and all application-level meaning.  A command-line JSON-schema
utility is useful for checking message validity during this process.

### Make it portable
An application API should be easily portable over any transport method such as
HTTP/S, WebSockets, XMPP, or SMTP.  A **JSON-Pure API** should be transport neutral,
and should require only minor adjustment to work over nearly any transport.

### Closing thoughts
The move away from **RESTful APIs** has already begun. Both FaceBook's
[Relay](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/05/01/graphql-introduction.html)
and Netflix's
[Falcor](http://netflix.github.io/falcor/documentation/jsongraph.html)
dispense with any *pretense* of being **RESTful** (Update 2018-12-29: And the
trend continues with GraphQL).

I expect that **REST** will continue to be used for the majority of web
traffic, especially content distribution.  However, the more sophisticated
APIs used by SPAs will move to more appropriate, **non-RESTful** design
patterns.  And that's a good thing.

I hope you found this useful, and as always, any constructive feedback is
welcome!

Cheers, Mike
