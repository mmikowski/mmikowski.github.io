## PowerCSS 1.0!
On Good Friday, we published the 1.0 release of the **MIT licensed** 
[PowerCSS][0] JavaScript library. PowerCSS provides many of the features of
Stylus, {less}, or Sass but with JavaScript-powered run-time styling.
It could make your static CSS files obsolete. Installation couldn't be easier
thanks to [npm][1]: `npm install powercss`.

## Recent changes
The final changes leading up to release were mostly "under-the-hood". The
most visible change was the completion of x-browser event creation even on
ancient browsers (I'm looking at you, IE 9). We also rewrote the symbol
resolver to handle arbitrarily-deep recursions, and expanded the regression
tests. You can run these tests too:

```bash
npm install powercss
cd node_modules/powercss
npm install
npm test
```

## The future
While using the module over the last few weeks for live and production-intent
applications, I have decided that version 1.1 should provide per-cascade
double-buffered stylesheets.  This will provide a simple way for feature
modules to provide isolated, real-time styling without taxing the browser
rendering engine.

What would you like to see for version 1.1?  Send me a note, file an issue,
or send a pull request at our [GitHub][2] repository!

Constructive feedback, question, and collaborators are always welcome!

Cheers, Mike
