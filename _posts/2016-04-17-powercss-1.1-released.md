*Run-time styling just got better*

![PowerCSS 1.1 released](/images/2016-02-22-pcss.png)

## Overview
On 2016-04-17 we released version 1.1 of the **MIT licensed** 
[PowerCSS][0] JavaScript library. PowerCSS provides many of the features of
Stylus, {less}, or Sass but with JavaScript-powered run-time styling.
It could make your static CSS files obsolete. Installation couldn't be easier
thanks to [npm][1]: `npm install powercss`.


## Recent changes
We bumped the version to 1.1 because there was a significant API addition:
support for arbitrary-depth nested conditional expressions. 
Media queries are now easily created and automatically optimized.
We added numerous regression tests and currently have 106 assertions:

```bash
npm install powercss
cd node_modules/powercss
npm install # dev dependencies
npm test
```

## The future
We still want to add per-cascade double-buffered stylesheets.  This way, 
each feature module could control its own isolated styling without
overt-taxing the rendering engine. Now, it's slated for version 1.2.

What would you like to see in PowerCSS? Send me a note, file an issue,

questions, and collaborators are always welcome!

Cheers, Mike
