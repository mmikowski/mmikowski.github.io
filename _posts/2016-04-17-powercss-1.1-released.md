*Run-time styling just got better*

![PowerCSS 1.1 released](/images/2016-02-22-pcss.png)

## Overview
On 2016-04-17 we released version 1.1 of the **MIT licensed** 
[PowerCSS][0] JavaScript library. PowerCSS provides many of the features of
Stylus, {less}, or Sass but with JavaScript-powered run-time styling.
It could make your static CSS files obsolete. Installation couldn't be easier
thanks to [npm][1]: `npm install powercss`.

We have seen over 1,500 npm downloads on the busiest days, and it often
exceeds 500. It looks like word is getting out about PowerCSS. We are
currently using it as a theme engine for a commercial web application
with great success.

## Recent changes
We bumped the version to 1.1 because there was a significant API addition:
support for arbitrary-depth nested conditional expressions. However, the
API remains almost completely backward compatible with version 1.0.
Media queries are now easily created and automatically optimized.
We added numerous regression tests to check this capability, and
currently have 106 assertions, which you can check like so:

```bash
npm install powercss
cd node_modules/powercss
npm install # dev dependencies
npm test
```

## The future
We still want to add per-cascade double-buffered stylesheets so that each
feature module could control its own stylesheet on-demand.
overt-taxing the rendering engine. Now, it's slated for version 1.2.
