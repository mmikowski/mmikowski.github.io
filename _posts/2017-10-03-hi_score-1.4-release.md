title: hi_score 1.4 released
---
*The full life-cycle starter project for SPAs just got a lot better - again*

![hi_score virtual appliance][_0A]

We just released Version 1.4.x which is a big ugrade from 1.3.x, which in turn
was a major upgrade from 1.2.x. Read on for more details.

# Overview
**`hi_score`** is a full-lifecycle starter project for web application development. It embodies good practice from over 20 years of experience for every lifecycle stage. **`hi_score`** embraces the feature-module (or "web component") design pattern, so it should work well with React or Vue.js. Please do swap assets and libraries as required - [that's the point][_02].

# So what's changed?
There were 41 commits since the 1.3.x series. Highlights include:

- Update virtual appliance as shown in the top image. Installing a
  reliable development environment doesn't get much easier.
- Fix bug in `bin/xhi` dependency sort.
- Add Typebomb a sophisticated skill building game.
- Patch font-awesome CSS to avoid path inclusion errors.
- Rewrite build system in JavaScript and use `package.json` as manifest
  (see `bin/xhi help build -v` for details).
- Enhance `js/xhi` libs and documentation.
- Update code standards and images.
- Fix a few dependencies in `bin/xhi` lifecycle tools.
- Change from `jslint` to `eslint` with configuration in `package.json`.

# Check it out
Download the latest [latest virual appliance][_03] to try `hi_score` with the minimum of time and hassle. Pick the latest `ova2` image for virutal box, and the latest `vmx` image for VMware or Parallels. If you need more help with installing a VM or wish to consider other options, please consult the "Development platform" section in the [hi_score][_01] documentation.

Open a terminal and enter the following lines. Wait for each to complete before proceeding to the next. The build process prompts the user to review TODO notes. Just press `return` to accept them.

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:mmikowski/hi_score.git
  cd hi_score
  bin/xhi build,dev_start
  google-chrome http://localhost:8080/build/latest/dist/
```

**`hi_score`** has three example applications. We suggest you check out Typebomb2 (`app-tb02.html`) which was just added. Use the Chrome developer tools to inspect the CSS, the DOM, and the JavaScript. Notice how CSS classes are obsfucated and namespaced. A snapshot of the Typebomb2 game in action is shown below.

Cheers, Mike
