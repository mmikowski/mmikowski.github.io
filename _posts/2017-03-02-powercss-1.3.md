*Run-time styling just got better*

![PowerCSS 1.3 released](/images/2016-02-22-pcss.png)

## Overview
On 2016-09-12 we released version 1.3 of the **MIT licensed** 
[PowerCSS][0] JavaScript library. PowerCSS provides many of the features of
Stylus, {less}, or Sass but with JavaScript-powered run-time styling.
It could make your static CSS files obsolete. Installation couldn't be easier
thanks to [npm][1]: `npm install powercss`.

## Recent changes
Key changes in version 1.3 include:
- Keyword definition moved to a separate file, `pcss.cfg.js`
- Removed bower support
- Added `setStyleAttr` method which can change selectors
  after the stylesheet has been written.
- Fully backward compatible to 1.0 API.

```bash
npm install powercss
cd node_modules/powercss
npm install # dev dependencies
npm test
```

## The future
We still want per-cascade double-buffered stylesheets so that each
feature module can cleanly control its own styling. That feature is
now is slated for version 1.4.
