# Overview
The **`hi_score`** development team is pleased to announce that version 1.0.0
has been released! This is a full life-cycle starter project for web application
client development. It embodies best practice accumulated from over 20 years of
continuous web development experience.

# Quick Start 
Installation requires a modern Linux distribution (VMs are great!) and three
commands:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:mmikowski/hi_score.git
$ cd hi_score
$ npm install && npm run prep-libs
```

# Test, Coverage, and Distribution 
One can then run tests, inspect coverage, and build a compressed distribution
of two example applications that are less than 10% the size of the source code:

```bash
$ npm test
$ npm run cover
$ google-chrome coverage/lcov-report/index.html
$ npm run buildify
$ tree build/dist
$ du -sh . build/dist
$ google-chrome build/dist/ex01.html build/dist/ex02.html
```

# Features
**`hi_score`** can really jump-start web client development.  With lots of
hard stuff resolved out-of-the-box, we can focus on improving things that really
matter, like the JavaScript, HTML, CSS and architecture we need for our application.

After installation, **`hi_score`** provides many highly desirable capabilities
that can be otherwise very difficult to orchestrate:

    # A proven standard directory structure
    # Vendor library management (npm install && npm run prep-libs)
    # Vendor font management (npm install && npm run prep-libs)
    # Code written to exacting [standards][05] to ensure readability
    # Automatic namespacing and run-time control of CSS using [PowerCSS][06]
    # Linting (JSLint, whitespace check, strict check)
    # Automatic in-line browsable HTML documentation (markdown + pandoc)
    # TDD and regression tests (nodeunit + JSDOM)
    # Commit-hook which ensures test and linting pass before check-in
    # Type-cast libraries
    # Code coverage (Istanbul)
    # Code coverage reporting (Coveralls)
    # Build system manifest (Buildify)
    # Build system compression (patched UglifyJS + SuperPack)
    # Distribution-ready code

Install **`hi_score`** today and start writing TDD driven client code
immediately. The project comes with recommended libraries, but feel free to
swap our your own.  That's the point.

# Learn more
This project intends to provide a more flexible and portable approach to writing
Single Page Web Applications than most [SPA frameworks][09].

Please see the [GitHub documentation][10] for full details.

Cheers, Mike
