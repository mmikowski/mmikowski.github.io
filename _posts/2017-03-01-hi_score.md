*Replace a flawed SPA framework with your own full life-cycle system*

# Overview
The *hi\_score* development team is pleased to announce that version 1.0.0
has been released! This is a full life-cycle starter project for web application
client development that embodies best practice accumulated from over 20 years of
continuous web development experience.

# Quick Start 
Installation requires a modern Linux distribution and three commands:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:mmikowski/hi_score.git
$ cd hi_score
$ npm install && npm run prep-libs
```

# Test, Coverage, and Distribution 
One can then run tests, inspect coverage, and build a compressed distribution
of two example applications that are less than 10% the size of the source code:

```bash
$ npm test
$ npm run cover
$ google-chrome coverage/lcov-report/index.html
$ npm run buildify
$ tree build/dist
$ du -sh . build/dist
$ google-chrome build/dist/ex01.html build/dist/ex02.html
```

# Features
Do you really want to jump start your web client development? Instead of
wasting time learning the new hot framework of the month, how about honing
your JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills in an architecture where lots of the hard
work is already accomplished? All you need to do is write feature modules!

After installation, **hi\_score** provides at least 15 substantial time
savers:

  1. A proven standard directory structure
  2. Vendor library management (npm install && npm run prep-libs)
  3. Vendor font management (npm install && npm run prep-libs)
  4. Code standards per [this guide][_04]
  5. Automatic namespacing of CSS
  6. Full run-time control of styling using [PowerCSS](http://powercss.org)
  7. Linting (JSLint, whitespace check, strict check)
  8. Automatic in-line browable HTML documentation (markdown + pandoc)
  9. TDD and regression tests (nodeunit + JSDOM)
  10. Commit-hook which runs 5-7 every time
  11. Code coverage (Istanbul)
  12. Code coverage reporting (Coveralls)
  13. Build system manifest (Buildify)
  14. Build system compression (patched UglifyJS + SuperPack)
  15. Distribution-ready code

Install **hi\_score** today and start writing TDD driven client code
immediately. The project comes with recommended libraries, but feel free to
swap our your own.  That's the point :)

# Learn more
This project was created in reponse to the problems associated with
[SPA frameworks](/no-frameworks).
