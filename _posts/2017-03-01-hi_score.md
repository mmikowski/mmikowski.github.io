*A full life-cycle starter project for SPAs*

![hi_score][01]

# Overview
Version 1.0.x of **`hi_score`** has has been released! This is a full life-cycle
starter project for web application client development. It embodies best
(or at least pretty-darn-good!) practices accumulated from over 20 years of
continuous web development experience.

# Quick Start
Installation requires a modern Linux distribution (VMs are great!) and three
commands:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:mmikowski/hi_score.git
$ cd hi_score
$ npm install && npm run setup
```

Installation has been verified on Ubuntu 16.04, 16.10, and CentOS 6.5.
Ubuntu users may find [this spreadsheet][02] useful.

# Test, Coverage, and Distribution
One can run tests, inspect coverage, and build a compressed distribution
of two example applications in less than a minute.  The distribution is less than that are less than 10% the size of the source code:

```bash
$ npm test
$ npm run cover
$ google-chrome coverage/lcov-report/index.html
$ npm run build
$ tree build/dist
$ du -sh . build/dist
$ google-chrome build/dist/ex01.html build/dist/ex02.html
```

# Features
**`hi_score`** can really jump-start web client development.  With lots of
hard stuff resolved out-of-the-box, we can focus on improving things that really
matter, like the JavaScript, HTML, CSS and architecture we need for our application.

After installation, **`hi_score`** provides many highly desirable capabilities
that can be otherwise very difficult to orchestrate:

- A proven standard directory structure
- Vendor library management (npm install && npm run setup)
- Vendor font management (npm install && npm run setup)
- Code written to exacting [standards][05] to ensure readability
- Automatic namespacing and run-time control of CSS using [PowerCSS][06]
- Linting (JSLint, whitespace check, strict check)
- Automatic in-line browsable HTML documentation (markdown + pandoc)
- TDD and regression tests (nodeunit + JSDOM)
- Commit-hook which ensures test and linting pass before check-in
- Type-cast libraries
- Code coverage (Istanbul)
- Code coverage reporting (Coveralls)
- Build system manifest (Buildify)
- Build system compression *including* property keys (auto-patched UglifyJS + SuperPack)
- Distribution-ready code

Install **`hi_score`** today and start writing TDD driven client code
immediately. The project comes with recommended libraries, but feel free to
swap our your own (but read the [docs][10] on how to do this). That's the point.

# Learn more
This project intends to provide a more flexible and portable approach to writing
Single Page Web Applications than most [SPA frameworks][09].

Please see the [GitHub documentation][10] for full details.

Cheers, Mike
