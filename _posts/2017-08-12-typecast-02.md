title: Type safety with native JavaScript v02
---
*Why everybody wants type safety and how to get it.*

![Typecast example](/images/2016-11-14-typecast-02.png)

This is an update from the [original article](/type-casts).
It is shorter, simpler, more logical, and more correct.

# 1. Overview
Many developer tools like IDEs, frameworks, libraries, and linters try
to provide some level of **type safety** to JavaScript. This article
explains what type safety is, why we want it, and how we can get it
using native JavaScript.

# 2. What is type safety?
Type safety is the extent a programming language discourages or prevents
**type errors**. A type error occurs when an unintended or incompatible type
value is provided to a function or expression, usually as an argument
or context. Dividing a number by an array is a perfect example.
Usually this doesn't make sense, yet JavaScript support this very operation,
often with surprising and unwanted results.

Let's see how easy it is to create a type error in Javascript using the
semantic style all the cool kids are using these days. **This is awful
code**, so please don't copy it. We'll improve it as we go along.

```js
  function repeats(counts, run)
  {
      while(counts < 0)
      {
          run(counts)
          counts+=1
      }
  }

  function reports(info)
  {
      console.log(info)
  }

  repeats('-3', reports)
```

That didn't take long! The first type error occurs when we provide the
'-3' argument to the `repeats` invocation. This value should be an
integer, but we instead provide a string. Then all hell breaks loose.

When `repeats` is invoked it creates an 'endless' loop condition that
will rather quickly consume all available resources within its execution
environment. This results in a force-kill of a NodeJS process, or a browser
tab, or the entire browser process, or the host OS.

If we watch the progression of the value of `counts` in the `while` loop we
see the following series: `'-3', '-31', '-311', '-3111', ...`. The test
condition `counts < 0` *does* convert the `counts` string into a number,
but by then it is too late: the value is always less than 0 and it only gets
more negative with each iteration. That's because the expression `counts+=1`
always converts the number `1` into a string `'1'` and *appends* it to the
`counts` variable.

# 3. Why do we want type safety?
We want type safety with JavaScript because type errors can be quite
troublesome:

1. They are easy to create
2. They are challenging to resolve
3. They are often serious

Let's look at each of these issues in turn.

## 3.1. JS type errors are easy to create
JavaScript is missing almost all type controls because it was not originally
intended to run large-scale applications. There are no type declarations,
return types are not reliable, there is no static type-checking, and one must
roll-their-own dynamic checking.

### 3.1.1 No type declarations
JavaScript has no means to formally declare a variable type. A variable may
contain any type which may be changed at any time during execution.
There are no *sigils* to identify type, and a variable name is
unconstrained. We probably all have seen a JavaScript application
or two where a single symbol like `watches` is used as an object, a map,
a list, a boolean flag, a string, an integer, and a floating point number
all in different contexts. Yet in practice most variables used in JavaScript
are not *intended* to change type *within* a context because doing so is
needlessly confusing.

Other languages provide a 'wild card' variables to reference any type of
value. These are usually easy to identify because they have a
unique syntax. Developers know they these 'wild cards' need to be
handled with care. In JavaScript, all variables are 'wild cards.'

### 3.1.2 Return types are not reliable
The return types of JavaScript expressions are often not reliable.
Many JavaScript operators are **polymorphic** and will return values
of different types dependant on the types of variables used.
For example, the JavaScript '+' operator can concatenate
strings *or* add numbers *or* converts a string to a number.
The return value can be suprising when varilable types are mixed
as illustrated below.

```js
  // Confirmed using Google V8 version 6.0.286.52
  console.log(process.versions.v8);
  //
  var x, y;
  // expression   // |     returned value | Coercion       | Op
  x = 3;          // |                 3  | -              |
  x = 3 + 1;      // |                 4  | -              | +num
  x = 3 + '1';    // |               '31' | 3      => '3'  | +str
  x = 3 + [];     // |                '3' | []     => ''   | +str
  x = 3 + [ 21 ]; // |              '321' | [ 21 ] => '21' | +str
  x = 3 + {};     // | '3[object Object]' | {}     => str  | +str
  x = '3' - 2;    // |                 1  | '3'    =>  3   | -num
  x = '3' + 2;    // |               '32' | 2      => '2'  | +str
  x = + '3';      // |                 3  | '3'    =>  3   | cast_num
  x = 0 + '3';    // |               '03' | 0      => '0'  | +str
  x = y + 3;      // |                NaN | -              | NaN
  x = y + '3';    // |       'undefined3' | undef  => str  | +str
```

This behavior (confirmed using Google V8 version
6.0.286.52; see `node -e 'console.log(process.versions.v8);'`)
is probably consistent across the across the four primary JavaScript
engines (V8, IonMonkey, Nitro, Chakra) and the [dozen of others][5]. 
However less popular operators probably have some variance across the engines
that can cause headaches.

Other languages have less complex behaviors because they usually have
stricter type checking, stricter coercion rules, fewer polymorphic
operators, and fewer vendors. **Perl**, for example, uses the dot (`.`)
operator to *join* strings and the plus (`+`) operator to add numbers.
Perl also uses *sigals* (prefixes) like `$`, `@`, and `%` to indicate 
types and a special syntax to identify 'wild-card' (type-glob) references.

### 3.1.3 No static checking
Many languages provide some level of static type checking.
**Java**, for example, resolves most variable types during compilation.
If JavaScript had a similar mechanism we wouldn't be able to run our
application until we resolved the compile errors.  In this imaginary world,
our JavaScript compile output might look like this:

```
00: ok                           | x = 3;          |
01: ok                           | x = 3 + 1;      |
02: compile_error: type_mismatch | x = 3 + '1';    |
03: compile_error: type_mismatch | x = 3 + [];     |
04: compile_error: type_mismatch | x = 3 + [ 21 ]; |
06: compile_error: type_mismatch | x = 3 + {};     |
07: compile_error: type_mismatch | x = '3' - 2;    |
08: compile_error: type_mismatch | x = '3' + 2;    |
09: compile_error: type_mismatch | x = + '3';      |
10: compile_error: type_mismatch | x = 0 + '3';    |
11: compile_error: type_mismatch | x = y + 3;      |
12: compile_error: type_mismatch | x = y + '3';    |
```

Perhaps the greatest advantage of static (compile-time) type checking is
that it can improve performance: every type check that can be
resolved *once* during a compile removes a type check that would
need to be invoked on *every* call of a function or method. This can
remove a large number of calls when the application is run and thus
improves performance.

### 3.1.4 Roll-your-own dynamic checking
Static type checking does not work in all situations, especially when
dealing with data from unknown or untrusted sources. 
In those cases we resort to *dynamic type checking*
at run-time. Native JavaScript tools for this purpose are limited.
For example, the `typeof` method does not distinguish between an object
and an array.

## 3.2. Type errors are challenging to resolve
Type errors can be hard to identify and debug. When one routine fails to
check for type an incorrect result can propagate up the call stack resulting
in a cascade of errors. The originating flaw can be hard to spot
if variable aren't named to indicate their intended type, like so:

```js
  // Cool-kid no-consistency convention:
  var total = watches / in_use;
```

However, if we name our variable by intended type the mismatches
become obvious:

```js
  // Sensible name convention
  var total_str = watch_list / use_bool;
```

Yes, the intended variable type **is that important**. We've had to maintain
plenty of third-party modules which used the *cool-kid no-consistency
convention* where variable names provide no hint of type or purpose, or worse,
are patently misleading. We'd rather name our variables sensibly and use the time
saved to focus on new challenges.

## 3.3. Type errors are often serious
As we have shown, type errors can result in severe application failures and
security holes. Imagine some NodeJS code that doesn't properly type-check
its JSON API. One could implement a Denial Of Service (DOS) attack and shut
down an entire cluster by simply sending strings instead of numbers in API
requests. This stuff happens.

# 4. How do we get type safety in Native JavaScript?
There are a few ways to improve JavaScript type safety. One approach involves
using libraries or frameworks such as [Flow][3] or [TypeScript][4] that
require transpiling or otherwise prepocessing the code.
Here we propose a simpler solution that may be especially well-suited for smaller
projects and requires only three steps.

1. Get typecast methods
2. Use typecasting
3. Name variables to indicate type

## 4.1. Get typecast methods
Typecasting, for the purposes of this article, is the process of converting
a value into the desired data type using a very strict set of rules.
Our typecasting functions either return **the requested value type** or 
**a failure value** which is `undefined` by default.

We can get typecast methods from the [hi\_score][1] project which is
easy to install (type `npm install hi_score` into a terminal). If you edit the
example application you can use all the `cast` methods from `xhi.util.js`.

```bash
  npm install hi_score
  cd hi_score
  bin/xhi setup
  google-chrome ./index.html
  # Open the JavaScript console to access xhi._util_ functions
```

You don't have to use the whole library; you can just crib the methods from
`xhi.util.js` if you want. Go ahead, you won't hurt anyone's feelings.
The typecast methods are as follows and have all been thoroughly tested
and quite well docmented in the project.

```
  castBool, castFn,  castInt, castJQ,
  castList, castMap, castNum, castObj, castStr
```

All typecast methods take one or two arguments. Only numbers, strings,
and integers are converted between types and only when the conversion is
unambiguous. Examples are shown below.

```js
  // return_data = castInt( <value-to-cast> [, <failure-value>] );

  return_data = castInt( 0      ); // 0
  return_data = castInt( '0'    ); // 0
  return_data = castInt( 'a'    ); // undefined
  return_data = castInt( []     ); // undefined
  return_data = castInt( 'a', 0 ); // 0
  return_data = castInt( [],  0 ); // 0
```

JavaScript tries hard to coerce types, and the results are often undesirable.
Blank cells are conditions where a type error exception is usually thrown.

| ''           | FALSE |      | 0    |       |      | ''         |
| '0'          | t     |      | 0    |       |      | '0'        |
| '1'          | t     |      | 1    |       |      | '1'        |

| 0            | FALSE |      | 0    |       |      | '0'        |

| ['ten','t']  | t | | NaN | ['ten','t'] | { 0: 'ten', 1: 't'}  | 'ten,t' |
| [10]         | t     |     | 10  | [10] | { 0 : 10 } | '10' |
| [10,20]      | t     |     | NaN | [10,20] | { 0: 10, 1:20 }  | '10,20' |
| false        | FALSE |     | 0   |      |     | 'false'  |
| function(){} | t     | function(){} | NaN | [] | {} | 'function(){}' |
| null         | FALSE |     | 0   |      |     | 'null'      |
| true         | t     |     | 1   |      |     | 'true'      |
| undefined    | FALSE |     | NaN |      |     | 'undefined' |
| {}           | t     |     | NaN | []   | {}  | '0'         |
| -Infinity    | t     | -Infinity  | |   |     | '-Infinity' |
| Infinity     | t     | Infinity   | |   |     | 'Infinity'  |


The `cast` methods are they are predictable, explicit, and self-documenting.
The only convert the most unambigous values. Blank cells are conditions where
the failure value (`undefined` by default) will be returned.
No exceptions are thrown by these methods.

| :---         | :---  | :--- | :--- | :---  | :--- | :---    |

| NaN          |       |      |      |       |      |         |

| true         | true  |      |      |       |      |         |
| undefined    |       |      |      |       |      |         |
| {}           |       |      |      |       | {}   |         |
| -Infinity    |       |      | -Infinity  | |      |         |
| Infinity     |       |      |  Infinity  | |      |         |


## 4.2 Use Typecasting
Let's adjust our example function to use `castInt` and `castFn`
to ensure the provided arguments are the correct type.  If they 
are not, the function will return without any further processing.

```js
  function repeats(arg_counts, arg_run)
  {
      var counts = castInt(arg_counts)
      var run = castFn(arg_run)
      if (!(counts && run)){return}

      while (counts < 0)
      {
          run(counts)
          counts+=1
      }
  }

  function reports(info)
  {
      console.log(info)
  }

  repeats('-3', reports)
```

The function is now impervious to most type errors.


## 4.3 Name variables to indicate type
Typecasting handles run-time type checking. Most benefits of static checking
can be realized by naming our variables to indicate their intended type. Most
static type errors become self-evident if we adhere to this convention.
Let's rewrite our code using the name convention from the 
[JS Code standard quick reference][b].

```js
  function repeatFn ( arg_map ) {
    var
      map = castMap( arg_map,  {} ),
      int = castInt( map._int_, 0 ),
      fn  = castFn(  map._fn_     ),
      idx
      ;

    if ( ! fn ) { return; }

    for ( idx = int; idx < 0; idx++ ) {
      fn( idx );
    }
  }

  function printToConsole ( idx ) { console.log( idx ); }

  repeatFn({ _int_ : '-3', _fn_ : printToConsole });
```

This code will now pass JSLint.  Thanks to the naming convention we can
tell that tell that `fn` should be a function and and `idx` should be
an integer immediately without the need to read other code, add mark-up
comments, or employ any transpiling.

The [full JS Code standard][a] discusses *why* a simple naming convention can
vastly reduce the need for comments. We think it's an interesting and 
compelling read if you're into that kind of thing.

Now that we have consistent named-by-type variables and better formatting,
we can easily read the code to create in-line API documentation.
Using the guide from the [code standard][a] we get the following:

```js
  // BEGIN utility method /repeatFn/
  // Summary   : repeatFn({ _int_ : <integer>, _fn_ : <function> )
  // Purpose   : Repeatedly call a function 'fn' as long as the
  //             counter 'int' is < 0.  After each call, 'int' is
  //             incremented by 1.  If the initial value of 'int'
  //             is not < 0 the function 'fn' is not called.
  // Example   : repeatFn({
  //               _int_ : -3,
  //               _fn_ : function (idx ) { console.log( idx ) }
  //             });
  // Arguments  : ( named )
  //   _fn_     : The function to execute. The current value of the
  //              index (idx) is provided as its sole argument.
  //   _int_    : The initial value of idx. Idx is incremented after
  //              _fn_ is executed. Thus a value of '-1' will result in a
  //              single execution of _fn_( idx );
  // Returns    : undefined
  // Throws     : none
  //
  function repeatFn ( arg_map ) {
    var
      map = castMap( arg_map,  {} ),
      int = castInt( map._int_, 0 ),
      fn  = castFn(  map._fn_     ),
      idx
      ;

    if ( ! fn ) { return; }
    for ( idx = int; idx < 0; idx++ ) {
      fn( idx );
    }
  }
  // END utility method /repeatFn/

  function printToConsole ( idx ) { console.log( idx ); }
  repeatFn({ _int_ : '-3', _fn_ : printToConsole });
```

Remember where we begged you not to copy our first code example?
Copy this code instead.  It is impervious to most type errors, readable,
testable, maintainable, compressable, and well documented. 

We can use the in-line API docs along with tools like `Istanbul` and
`nodeunit` to crete tests for our type-safe `repeatFn`
function. Check out the test suite for [hi\_score][1] to see how this
can be accomplished.

# 5. What about frameworks and libraries?
How does this simple technique compare with [Flow][3] and [TypeScript][4]?
We still intend to publish a sequel that will answer this question.

Remember to use typcasting only when processing external data and inputs of
public methods. Rely on the name convention to communicate intended type
of variables in private methods and variables.

We hope you found this useful! Please share your thoughts and experiences
in the comments below.
