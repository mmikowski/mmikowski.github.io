## News
### 2019-12-02
- Added Assessment advising against 19.10 due to regressions

### 2019-11-02
- Add System Settings paths
- Verified and updated Apt sources
- Audit through Section 9

## Assessment of 19.10 as of 2019-12-02
After extensive testing we **do NOT recommend 19.10 for daily use**. There are two
marjor regressions that remain unresolved.

1. The CPU throttling on at least some CPUs (confirmed on i7-9750H and
   i7-8750H) does not work, with the frequency always pegged at maximum. This
   results in less battery life and higher heat.

2. Geekbench4 scores are reduced to 50% of their values prior to updates (26K
   vs. 13K, for example) on these same processors. 

We strongly advise using 19.04 or 18.04 where these regressions do not exist.

### If you chose 19.10
The 19.10 regressions will result in lower performance and higher power
consumption. However, they may be resolved in the near future as we have filed
bug reports with Kubuntu developers. There are a few additional Plasma bugs
that are annoying (e.g. lock screen image selection) but minor. Using a LiveCD
to test the regressions DOES NOT work as they do not occur until after initial updates.
We are currently monitoring progress using an alternate 19.10 install.

### If you choose 19.04
We found 19.04 very stable and performant over 6 months of average 10 hour days
using it. Backports provides most of the desirable new KDE features. However,
it has an EOL date of 2020-01-18, and therefore there may not be a direct
upgrade path to 20.04 LTS. If you insist on 19.04, you may need to back up
data and then install 20.04 LTS fresh in May 2020.

### If you choose 18.04
This is also very stable and performant. Backports provides many desirable
features, but some from KDE are missing. The upgrade path to 20.04 LTS is
obvious.

## Introduction
### Purpose
Provide a complete and thoroughly tested guide to install, configure, and
optimize Kubuntu 19.10 (K19-10) and web development tools.

- Show screen shots for almost every step
- Ensure answers are thorough and well-researched
- Provide an explanation for each step
- Add links to external resources when beneficial

### Why *this* guide?
**Because it works.** The entire procedure has been end-user-tested five times
with the author present. Feedback from these sessions was used to ensure
accuracy and minimize the opportunity for mistakes.

### Why Kubuntu?
The Plasma Desktop with KDE apps looks great, is easy to use, starts and runs
fast, and is [easy on resources][_0010].  Kubuntu is an Ubuntu derivative so
it has the widest array of commercial Linux application support available.
The **Apt** package ecosystem is mature and almost all software can be
installed with it.  Daily updates keep the software current and remove
security risks quickly.

### Why this Author?
The author has used Unix or Linux as his primary OS for web app development
since 1993. He adopted RedHat in 1998 and then Kubuntu in 2006. He has managed
the software on multiple Linux clusters with dozens of servers each. He is
also RHEL5 certified (giggle if you must) and is the author and maintainer of
[Kubuntu Preferred Apps Spreadsheet][_0020].

### How to use this guide
This is a long document with 98 screen shots, and it is far too easy to scroll
past a step when using the scrollbar. To avoid this we suggest using using the
arrow keys to scroll instead, and pay attention to the step number to ensure
it is in order.

## 1. Select Hardware [(top)](#toc) {#section1}
Select hardware that is tested and compatible with Desktop Linux.

- CPU: AMD or Intel x86. Both are excellent.
- GPU: Nvidia or Intel. Prefer Nvidia for superior performance, stability,
  CUDA, deep learning support. AMD GPUs have gotten much better recently,
  but the author has not worked with them.
- Keyboard: We like the Logitech K310 washable keyboard. Of course, just about
  any keyboard will work just fine.
- Pointer: We like the Logitech MarbleMouse. The trackball provides great
  control while avoiding repetitive stress injuries. Again, just about any
  3-button or scroll-wheel mouse will work fine.
- Webcam: We like the Logitech Webcam C615. Works out-of-the-box with
  Hangouts, Skype, Zoom, and other apps. Includes 1080p/30fps and a good mic.

See [Appendix A](#appendix-a) for my most desktop recent build which has been
amazing. See [Appendix C](#appendix-c) if you would like to purchase a
ready-to-use laptop.  When purchasing a laptop, select one designed and shipped
with Linux like those offered by System76, Dell, or Levono. Otherwise, look
online to find those that work best with Ubuntu. Make sure key capabilities
like screen, WiFi, webcam, trackpad, keyboard, GPU, monitor, battery, and
power management are well supported.  **Do not** attempt to install on a
recent MacBook Pro.  Apple is openly hostile to Linux on their hardware and
have ensured the experience is at best miserable and likely impossible.

## 2. Prepare Install Image [(top)](#toc) {#section2}
### 2.1. Download the ISO Image
Download the [19.10 bootable ISO image][_0030] directly from Kubuntu, it
should be named `kubuntu-19.10-desktop-amd64.iso`. Enter the following into the
terminal to ensure the SHA256 checksum matches the one [found on this
page][_0040]. The checksum will change as the ISO is updated
so please modify the `_hash='...'` line as needed.

```bash
# Change this hash with value provided from kubuntu.org
_hash='e56388512a0610bd991192b197a13f1496c107377d9c96d332939c08e305b028' \
&& if ( sha256sum kubuntu-19.10-desktop-amd64.iso |grep -v "${_hash}"); then
  echo "--- Results ---"
  echo 'FAIL. DO NOT USE this ISO, it does not match checksum';
  echo 'Please notify Kubuntu of this issue.'
else
  echo '--- Results ---'
  echo 'SUCCESS. ISO passes checksum';
fi
```

### 2.2. Create Bootable USB Drive
#### 2.2.1. When using a virtual machine
Skip this step. VirtualBox uses the ISO file directly.

#### 2.2.2. When using a physical computer
Insert a small (4-8GB) USB drive into the computer with the downloaded ISO
image. When using a the Ubuntu OS, we may install the **Start Disk Creator**
with `sudo apt install -y usb-creator-kde`. Similar tools are available for
other OSes.  Select the ISO image and select the USB drive and the click on
**Make Startup Disk**. All content of the USB drive will be replaced in this
operation.

![2.2.2. Startup Disk Creator][_i0010]

To use the CLI instead, see this [Ask Ubuntu answer][_0050]

## 3. Review Selected Apps [(top)](#toc) {#section3}
Review the K19-10 Selected Apps chart below. These apps are installed or
optional in the steps below. Adjust as needed. If you feel an app should be
here but isn't, please let me know in the comments!

## 4. Create a Virtual Machine [(top)](#toc) {#section4}
Skip this section when installing on a physical computer.

### 4.1. Why a virtual machine?
We recommend using a virtual machine to test Kubuntu 19.10 and apps before
committing to a full upgrade or installation on a physical computer.  Our
testing to date has shown all apps work well with just some config
adjustments.

### 4.2. Install VirualBox
When using an Ubuntu 16.04+ derivative (Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, probably
Mint and quite a few others) as the **Host OS**, enter the code below into a
terminal to install. For other OSes, see the [VirtualBox site][_0060].

```bash
sudo install virtualbox virtualbox-ext-pack virtualbox-guest-additions-iso
```

- `virtualbox` is the core app
- `virtualbox-ext-pack` enables USB2+ and other advanced features
- `virtualbox-guest-additions-iso` provides additions used by
   **Guest OS** to provide an improved experience.

### 4.3. Create virtual machine
Start VirtualBox and click on **New**.

![4.3. Create virtual machine][_i0020]{:.noshadow}

### 4.4. Set details
Inspect every field here. Try to provide at least 4GB of RAM for testing
purpose. Plasma is pretty light on resources, but apps like **Gimp** and
**IntelliJ** eat lots of RAM when editing large images or projects.

### 4.8. Configure display {#enable3D}
Turn off compositing **\<shift + alt + f12\>** on **both** the host and guest OS to
maximize performance. Make sure to select **VBoxSVGA** as the **Graphics
Controller** and **Enable 3D Acceleration**. Do not **Enable 2D Video
Acceleration**.

## 5. Install Kubuntu 19.10 [(top)](#toc) {#section5}
### 5.1. Boot from the USB Drive
#### 5.1.1 When using a virtual machine
VirtualBox prompts for the ISO file to boot from when a new virtual
computer is started. Provide the ISO file previously downloaded, e.g.
`kubuntu-19.10-beta-desktop-amd64.iso`.

#### 5.1.2 When using a physical computer
Power-off the target computer and insert the Bootable USB Drive into a
USB port and then power-on. One may need to select the boot device
(typically using the F12 key) if the installer does not appear and try
again.

### 5.2. Click `Install Kubuntu`
Once the installer is present, click on **Install Kubuntu** to begin.

![5.2. Click Install Kubuntu][_i0190]

### 5.3. Select keyboard
This typically requires no changes.

![5.3. Select keyboard][_i0200]

### 5.4. Select default install
Select the default install. Skimping on tools to save perhaps a GB or two of
diskspace is hardly worth it. **Enable** third-party software for graphics,
hardware, and media.

![5.4. Select default install][_i0210]

### 5.5. Specify storage
There are a few options to configure storage. Pick one of the two below.

#### 5.5.1. Encrypted storage
Enter the same password in each of the two text boxes. If one clicks
`Continue` and then `Back` the LVM will be written to disk. Don't do that,
One can use `fdisk` from the live CD to remove the partitions if needed. More
detail is outside of the scope of this article.

![5.5.1 Specify encrypted storage][_i0215]

#### 5.5.2. Specify custom partitions
Skip this section if encropted storage was used.

Select **Manual** and click **Continue** to partition disk.

![5.5.2. Specify custom partition][_i0220]

Click to select the `/dev/sda` device and click **Add**. A modal window
appears. Set the **Size** to **8192 MB**, set the **Type** to **swap space**,
and then approve the partition. This swap is used by the system and also is
needed (or at least preferred) for the suspend-to-disk feature of the OS.

Click again on the `/dev/sda` device and click **Add**. A similar modal window
appears. Accept the **Size** value to use all the remaining space.  Set
**Type** to **Ext4** and set **Mount point** to **/** and then approve the
partition.

![5.5.2. Add partitions ][_i0230]

Click on **Install Now**. A modal window appears warning that continuing
**will remove** any prior content in the partitions. Click on **Continue** to
proceed.

![5.5.2. Commit partitions][_i0240]

### 5.6. Select time zone
Select a time soon and click **Continue**.

![5.6. Select time zone][_i0250]

### 5.7. Create admin user
This user is granted admin (sudo) rights.

![5.7. Create admin user][_i0260]

### 5.8. Watch the slide show
A test install with 40MB/s internet and fast hardware took 3 minutes, but it
could take quite a bit longer if the storage, internet, memory, or CPU is
slow.

![5.8. Watch the slide show][_i0270]

More slides appear as the installation progresses. This is normal.

![5.8. Keep watching][_i0280]

### 5.9. Reboot
Elect to reboot the system after installation is complete.

![5.9. Reboot][_i0290]

## 6. Apply Updates [(top)](#toc) {#section6}
### 6.1. First sign-in
This sign-in screen should appear 20-30s after boot. Enter the username
and password provided earlier.

![6.1. First sign-in][_i0300]

### 6.2. Enjoy the splash screen
On modern hardware this appears appears for less than 5 seconds, and often
less than one second. We disable it in the steps below.

![6.2. Enjoy the splash screen][_i0310]

### 6.3. Review desktop
This is the default desktop.

![6.3. Review desktop][_i0320]

### 6.4. Open Discover app
The user is notified of updates on sign-in. One should apply updates updates
immediately after install and at the beginning of every work day. Click on
**Update** in the notification to open the Discover software package

## 8. Add Repos and Install [(top)](#toc) {#section8}
The **Apt** software management system in all Debian Linux system is simpler
and more complete than other OSes. Almost all third-parties provide **Apt**
support for their software with a few exceptions. Below we add the repos
needed for the software we wish to install and keep current.  Most of the
repos are [PPAs][_0062].  Packages are are signed which greatly reduces the
opportunity for a bad actor to insert a **Trojan Horse** like a key-logger or
phone-home feature into them.

The typical way to add a repo is to use the a command like `sudo
add-apt-repository "${_repo_spec}"`. This method ensures that encryption keys
are added to the package management database. Commercial vendors typically use
a similar process but add keys in a separate step. In this guide we use a
script to download registered keys all at once.

### 8.1. Open Konsole
The KDE terminal app is called **Konsole**. Press **\<alt + space\>** and
type **konsole** and then press **\<enter\>** to quickly find and start it.

#### 10.3.4. Install to /usr/local/lib
Enter the the following in a terminal to install Balsmiq into `/usr/local/lib`
Beware that we may need to change names and links if the downloaded file
changes. For example, if the download file is updated to verion `3.5.18`, we
should use `baslamiq_3_5_18` for our symbolic link and update the source
filename as well.

```bash
_src='Balsamiq_Mockups_3.5.17_bundled.zip';
_tgt='balsamiq_3_5_17';
_dir='Balsamiq_Mockups_3';
_result='';
sudo ls >/dev/null && if [ 1 ]; then
  pushd /usr/local/lib;
  sudo /bin/rm -rf "${_dir}";
  if ( sudo unzip ~/Downloads/"${_src}" ); then
    sudo ln -s "${_dir}" "${_tgt}";
    sudo ln -s "${_dir}" balsamiq
    pushd /usr/local/lib/balsamiq
    sudo ln -s 'Balsamiq Mockups 3.exe' balsamiq.exe
    _result='SUCCESS: Balsamiq installed and links configured';
    popd;
  else
    _result='FAIL: Balsamiq install, could not unbundle';

fi
echo "${_result}";
```

#### 10.3.5. Add desktop file
Enter the following into the terminal to install a desktop file so one can
easily access the app from the **K-menu**. We use symbolic links for references so
we should not need to update this file.

### 10.4. IntelliJ
#### 10.4.1. Download IntelliJ Ultimate
IntelliJ Ultimate is a great productivity tool in our experience. A free 30
trial is provided, and an individual license is [$149 a year][_0100].  For us,
it is much worth it. Other Jetbains options include Webstorm, Pycharm,
Rubymine, and others. We might consider [Komodo IDE ][_0110], Eclipse,
KDevelop, or others, but we do not have recent experience with them.  Download
from the [JetBrains website][_0120].

![10.4.1. Download IntelliJ Ultimate 1][_i0860]

Save the download as file.

![10.4.1. Download IntelliJ Ultimate 2][_i0870]

Enter the following into the terminal to ensure the SHA256 checksum matches
the one provided by JetBrains (click on the SHA256 link).  The checksum will
change as the package is update, so please modify the `_hash='...'` line
accordingly.

```bash
# Change this hash with value provided from JetBrains
pushd ~/Downloads
_hash='102a925396f2edd5d67b823fe14f3547e3d109c2a63a313c81fa2185cf8b98a1' \

![10.4.2. Install to /usr/local/lib 2][_i0890]

#### 10.4.3. Create symbolic links
Symbolic links ensures the paths used by the desktop do not change. We update
the link to new pointers when we upgrade IntelliJ. Notice the IntelliJ release
number (`192.6817.14` in the code below) changes with every release and the
**\_tgt\_dir** variable must be changed when that happens.  Enter the
following into the terminal create the desired links.

```bash
_tgt_dir="idea-IU-192.7142.36" && sudo ls >/dev/null && \
  if [ -d "/usr/local/lib/${_tgt_dir}" ]; then
    sudo /usr/bin/rm /usr/local/lib/intellij
    pushd /usr/local/lib; sudo ln -s "${_tgt_dir}" intellij; popd
    if [ ! -L /usr/local/bin/intellij ]; then
      pushd /usr/local/bin;
      sudo ln -s ../lib/intellij/bin/idea.sh intellij;
      popd
    fi
    if [ ! -d /usr/local/img ]; then
      sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/img;
      pushd /usr/local/img;
      sudo ln -s ../lib/intellij/bin/idea.svg ./intellij.svg;
      popd
    fi
    echo "--- Results ---";
    echo "SUCCESS: Installed IntelliJ symlinks";
  else
    echo "--- Results ---";
    echo "FAIL   : Installed IntelliJ symlinks";
    echo "  Please ensure distribution has been installed at ${_tgt_dir}";
    echo "  Update the version if needed in this script and try again.";
  fi
```

### 10.5. Google Drive (Insync)
Insync provide reliable sync to Google Drive with an unlimited number of
accounts.  It costs [$30 per year][_0130] and provides automatic conversion to
LibreOffice files. Enter the following into the terminal to install insync and
the file manager integration.

```bash
sudo apt install -y insync insync-dolphin && insync start
```

We prefer to use Dropbox over GDrive for many uses. GDrive is around 20x
slower than Dropbox for when syncing file.  In addition Google scans
*everything* put into GDrive whereas Dropbox does not.

### 10.6. Jekyll for Github.io Blogs
Enter the following into the terminal to install Jekyll for use with Github
blogs.

```bash
sudo apt install jekyll && sudo gem install jekyll-sitemap
```

After installation is complete, one can start Jekyll in an appropriate

### 11.2. Link config files
**After dropbox has synced**, we can link config files from Dropbox.
This helps minimize variance from one environment to another. **We must
create these files into Dropbox first.** Please skip this section if
these files have not been created in the Dropbox folder.

```bash
cd;
for _i in bashrc gitconfig vimrc;
  do _tgt=".${_i}";
  if [ -e "${_tgt}" ] && ! [ -L "${_tgt}" ]; then mv "${_tgt}" "${_tgt}.O"; fi
  rm -f "${_tgt}"; ln -s "Dropbox/01_SharedConfig/${_i}" "${_tgt}";
  if [ -e "${_tgt}.O" ]; then
    echo "Merge old config into linked ${_tgt}.";
    echo "To keep all changes, just close Meld.";
    echo "Press <enter> to continue.";
    read -r _ignore;
    meld "${_tgt}.O" "${_tgt}";
  fi
done
```

#### 11.4.1. Install the nfsv4 client
Enter the following into the terminal to ensure the NFSv4 client is
installed.

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y nfs-common
```

#### 11.4.2. Add NFS drives
Any drive in `/etc/fstab` marked with a `_netdev` will not be mounted until
the *after* the network is available. This is needed for  NFS and other
network file systems. See [Ubuntu NFSv4][_0140] and [NFSv4 at Boot][_0150].

Add NFS drives in `/etc/fstab`, one per line, using the following format.

```
<nfs_server>:<export_dir> <mount_dir> nfs _netdev,auto 0 0
```

### 11.5. Optimize Chrome GPU

noted below). I do not have and recent experience AMD GPUs (thanks to my past
experience with AMD GPUs and Linux).

#### 11.5.1. VDPAU
Enter the following into the terminal to ensure VDPAU drivers are installed.

```bash
sudo apt install -y vdpau-driver-all vdpauinfo
```
#### 11.5.2. Change Chrome flags
Enable all GFX acceleration in Chrome.  Check GPU status with chrome://gpu.
Adjust flags to enable GPU capabilities in chrome://flags and enable these
flags. These names are exact as of Chome 77.

-  GPU Rasterization
-  Native client
-  Out of ordered rasterization
-  Override software rendering list
-  Skia API for OOP-D compositing
-  Zero-copy rasterizer

#### 11.5.3. Update desktop file
Enter the following into the terminal to edit the google-chrome desktop file.

```bash
sudo kate /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop
```
Replace `Exec=/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable`
with `Exec=/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable --enable-native-gpu-memory-buffers
--enable-zero-copy`. There are be 3 replacements.

Enter the following into the terminal to find and (optionally) delete any
`google-chrome.desktop` files that could override the system file.

```bash
sudo rm -i $(sudo updatedb && locate google-chrome.desktop \
  | grep -v '/usr/share/applications' )
```

At this point, all the apps from the table are installed and optimized.

11.6. Additional tweaks
See [Plasma Tips][_0165] for additional tweaks, especially for Chrome.

## 12. Trouble Shooting {#section12}
### Starting Kmail
#### Problem
When starting Kmail, Akonadi errors on start-up. This appears to be a problem
due to using MySQL instead of the now default MariaDB.

#### Solution
Edit `~/.local/share/akonadi/mysql.conf` and comment out the following lines:

```bash
# log_warnings=2
# lower_case_table_names=1
# query_cache_size=0
# query_cache_type=0
```

### 2019-10-22 Kmail and Gmail
#### Problem
Adding a Gmail account to Kmail was failing with a message that Google does
not recognize Kmail as a trusted app. See [this bug report][_0160].

#### Solution
1. Enable [less secure apps][_0170]. One may need to approve via an email sent
   to the gmail account used.  Grant approval.
2. In Kontact, add the Google account by clicking on **Settings \> Configure
   Kmail \> Receiving \> Add**. A window will popup to request Gmail
   authorization.  Enter your details. A warning will be returned that states
   **Sign in with Google temporarily disabled for this app. This app has not
   yet been verified by Google in order to use Google Sign in.** Click on
   cancel and proceed to decline encryption (this can be added later if
   desired).
3. After adding the account, in **Receiving** tab click on the account just
   added and click **Modify**.
4. A modal window will appear. Click on the **Advanced** tab and then
   under **Connection Settings** click on **Auto Detect**. Next, in the
   **Authentication** pulldown near the bottom, select **PLAIN**.
5. On the **Sending** tab, click on the account and then click **Modify**.
   This will bring up a modal window.
6. Under the **Advanced** table, click **Auto Detect** at the top.
7. Click **Ok** to clse the modal, and **OK** to close the account setting
   window.

Syncing should start and sending emails should work.

### 2019-10-22 Kmail and Yahoo
#### Problem
After adding a Yahoo acount Kmail reports that it `Could not connect to the
IMAP server...`.

#### Solution
This arises because Yahoo now uses App passwords.
1. Log in to Yahoo mailbox and click on your name at the top-right corner.
   Click on **Account Info** to go to that page.
2. Choose **Account Security** and then **Manage App Passwords**.
3. Select **Other** as your app name and provide **Kmail** as the app name.
   Then request the password.
4. Copy the provide password to the clipboard.
5. In Kontact, add the Yahoo account by clicking on **Settings \> Configure
   Kmail \> Receiving \> Add**. Provide your normal username, but use the
   App password copied above.

Syncing should now start and sending emails should work.
