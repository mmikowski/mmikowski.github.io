title: hi_score 1.3 released
---
*The full life-cycle starter project for SPAs just got a lot better*

![hi_score][01]

# Overview
**`hi_score`** is a full-lifecycle starter project for web application client development. It embodies best (or at least pretty-darn-good) practices accumulated from over 20 years of continuous web development experience for every stage of deveplment. **`hi_score`** embraces the feature-module (or "web component") design pattern, so it should work well with React or Vue.js projects.

# So what's changed?
We just released Version 1.3.x which is a **huge** ugrade from 1.2.x.

- We now offer a ready-made a virtual appliance so setup could hardly be easier.
- Added a universal `xhi` tool which automates almost every stage of development.
- Sophisticated `xhi` dependency checking ensures all prerequisites are met before attempting to run a lifecycle stage. This elimitates all sorts of silly mistakes.
- The build system (`xhi build`) now creates a unique build directory for each `git` commit. Coverage reports, metadata, and a distribution directory are included in each build number. This facilitates deployments, debugging, and rollbacks. The most recent build is always linked to `latest`.
- Cleaned-up the `js/xhi` browser libraries. JSLint is now configured centrally in `config/jslint.conf`. And some tests that broke across timezones are now fixed.

# Check it out
Installation is trivial once the development environment is ready. Just open a terminal and paste three lines:

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:mmikowski/hi_score.git
  cd hi_score; export PATH=`pwd`/bin:$PATH;
  xhi build && google-chrome build/latest/dist/ex0*.html
```

Please check out [hi_score][10] for complete details. Feedback and advice is much appreciated!

Cheers, Mike
