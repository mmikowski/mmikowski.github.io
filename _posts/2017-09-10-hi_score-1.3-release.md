title: hi_score 1.3 released
---
*The full life-cycle starter project for SPAs just got a lot better*

![hi_score][01]

# Overview
**`hi_score`** is a full-lifecycle starter project for web application client development. It embodies best (or at least pretty-darn-good) practices accumulated from over 20 years of continuous web development experience. And just like React or Vue.js, it embraces feature-module (or "web component") design patterns.

# So what's changed?
We just released Version 1.3.x and it is a **huge** update from 1.2.x.

- Added a virtual appliance so setup could hardly be easier.
- Added a universal `xhi` tool to guide developers to necessary tasks and added sophisticated dependency checking to help them avoid mistakes.
- The build system now creates a unique build directory for each `git` commit. Coverage reports, metadata, and a distribution directory are included in each build number. This facilitates deployments, debugging, and rollbacks. The most recent build is always linked to `latest`.
- Cleaned-up the `js/xhi` browser libraries. JSLint is now configured centrally in `config/jslint.conf`. And some tests that broke across timezones are now fixed.

# Check it out
Please check out [hi_score][10] and let me know what you think. Also always, feedback and advice is much appreciated.

Cheers, Mike
