title: PowerCSS approaching Beta
---
*Dump {less} and Sass and create custom styles for every user*

Today I am taking the wraps off of PowerCSS, an all-new OSS JS
library that provides dynamic CSS techniques that [I've advocated
for years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnkMjzhxw4s).

Unleash PowerCSS to create custom CSS for every user that visits your site.
PowerCSS uses merging, caching, compression, and double-buffering to exceed
the speed and flexibility of static CSS.

The code is approaching Beta as most features are now implemented.
The quite thorough documentation and code are available from [npm
](https://www.npmjs.com/package/powercss), although I recommend clone the
[GitHub](https://github.com/mmikowski/powercss) repo and looking at the
examples too.

I'd write more, but honestly, I'm pooped!  There's lot of documentation and
four examples already on the site, and I'm hoping to complete the features
in the following week.  As always, constructive feedback, question, and 
help are always welcome!

Cheers, Mike
