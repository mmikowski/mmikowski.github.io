title: PowerCSS approaching Beta
---
*Dump {less} and Sass and create custom styles for every user*

Today we are taking the wraps off of PowerCSS, an all-new OSS JS
library that provides dynamic CSS techniques that [I've advocated
for years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnkMjzhxw4s).

Unleash PowerCSS to create custom CSS for every user that visits your site.
PowerCSS uses merging, caching, compression, and double-buffering to exceed
the speed and flexibility of static CSS.

The code is approaching Beta as most features are now implemented.
The code and core documentation are available from [npm
](https://www.npmjs.com/package/powercss). We recommend you
clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mmikowski/powercss)
repo and browse through the examples.

There's lot of documentation and four examples already on the site, 
and we're hoping to complete all the features by next week. 
Constructive feedback, question, and help are always welcome!

Cheers, Mike
