title: Using KSysGuard
---
*System monitor tool for KDE*

### Overview

**KSysGuard** is a very flexible tool that ships with the
KDE 5<sup id="a1">[\*](#f1)</sup> desktop for monitoring and managing your
workstation using available sensors.

This post intends to replace the already-very-gentle learning curve
with a "just look at the pictures, man!" guide.  I will walk you through
adding a new monitoring tab as I recently did to monitor my CPU and GPU
temperatures on my laptop.

### The use-case

Recently I bought a new [System76 laptop][2] for development work.
And while it does a great job as a mobile development workstation, it
also has caught the attention and admiration of both [Gabe Newell's][3]
closest friend and advisor - my 9-year-old son - and my 17-year-old nephew.
The interest may be due to the 100% sRGB IPS panel, GSYNC, the Nvidia GTX 970M
GPU, a wicked-fast Skylake 14nm Core i7 CPU, a blazing PCI-e SSD, or
well-stocked Steam client.  Or maybe all of the above.

Whatever the case, the laptop has seen *a lot* for gaming sessions when daddy 
isn't running WebStorm, and the cooling fans have been spinning quite a bit - although
thankfully they aren't obtrusive. However, I did want to make sure the hardware
wasn't being pushed to thermal limits.

### Installation

**KSysGuard** has been around for a very long time and is very mature,
yet I always have had the RonCo Rotisserie mentality of [set it and forget it][4].
This time, I decided to document my steps for posterity.

Before I started I reviewed the [Kubuntu guide][5].  I made sure that the 
Kubuntu backports repository was enabled so we would have the latest KDE bug
fixes and features.  If you want to use **KSysGuard** and it isn't already
installed, `sudo apt-get install ksysguard` should do the trick.

### Configuration

We may either type `ksysguard` at the command line, or use the application
menu to launch **KSysGuard** under `Applications > System > System Monitor`.  When the application opens, we should see a `Process Table` tab 
similar to the image below.  This is a nice graphical process manager,
but not the focus of our work here today.

The other default tab is the system load.  Here we see usefull
information about CPU, memory, and network load:

![System load](/images/2015-12-29/m02.jpg)

If we want a new tab that shows temperature information, we can
add one by selecting `File -> New Tab...`:

![New tab](/images/2015-12-29/m03.jpg)

Notice we could have downloaded or imported tabs.  This is handy for sharing
configurations on many computers.  Something to keep in mind.

The image below shows the default configuration for our new tab. 

![Tab defaults](/images/2015-12-29/m04.jpg)

We modify our tab configuration to give it a more meaningful name, `Temps`;
and we specify a 2-row, 1-column layout.

![Tab settings](/images/2015-12-29/m05.jpg)

Once we enter our configuration, we are presented with our layout of graphs on
the left, and an array of sensors on the right:

![Initial layout](/images/2015-12-29/m06.jpg)

The graphs are initially empty, with simply the words `Drop Sensor Here`.  We
can do just that to get our first graph in place. 

### Add the CPU graph

The first graph we will tackle will show CPU temperatures.  We can take
our Physical CPU temperature sensor and drag it on the first `Drop Sensor
Here` we see.  The available sensors will vary depending on the computer
and the software we have installed.

![Drop first sensor](/images/2015-12-29/m07.jpg)

Once we've dragged a sensor onto the graph area, we can specify the type of
graph we'd like to see.  Generally, line graphs are best for temperature, as
not only do we see current temperature, but we can also spot trends.

![Select line graph](/images/2015-12-29/m08.jpg)

Once we select `Line graph` we are presented with just that.

![Show line graph](/images/2015-12-29/m09.jpg)

However, we'd like to standardize this graph to work of our expected data.  We
can select `Properties` from the right-click menu to adjust the graphing
paramters:

![Select properties](/images/2015-12-29/m10.jpg)

Now we will adjust our graph.  The first image shows the default presentation.

![Default graph properites](/images/2015-12-29/m11.jpg)

Our first task is to rename this graph to something a little more useful:

![Rename graph](/images/2015-12-29/m13.jpg)

Now we specify a reasonable temperature range.  A fixed range is desirable to
prevent human errors.

![Adjust graph scale](/images/2015-12-29/m14.jpg)

We leave the grid details as we found them:

![Graph grid](/images/2015-12-29/m15.jpg)

We also leave our first sensor as we find it.  However, if we wanted to change
the color or change the precidence of this value, we would do it here:

![List of sensors in a graph](/images/2015-12-29/m17.jpg)

And here we are, our first CPU temperature monitor has been added.  It appears
this sensor shows the overall CPU temperature. 

![Graph of overall CPU temperature](/images/2015-12-29/m18.jpg)

Now we can add the individual cores.  We start with Core 0 and drag it to the
existing graph:

![Add core 0](/images/2015-12-29/m19.jpg)

And we follow up with the other cores:

![Add more cores](/images/2015-12-29/m20.jpg)
![And more ...](/images/2015-12-29/m21.jpg)

When we are finished, we can see that we have added 5 sensors total to this
graph, and it is quite useful!

Now let's tackle the GPU and System graph.

### Add the GPU + System graph

Graphing the GPU temperatures is similar to graphing the CPU.  However, its is
a little more prone to error, as it's not always apparent what sensor applies
to which.  I discovered which temperature correlated with actual GPU
temperature by using the [Uningine Heaven][6] benchmark.

First we drag the temperature sensor from thermal zone 0 to our other graph:

![Start the Sys + GPU graph](/images/2015-12-29/p01.jpg)

Again select a line graph:

![Select line graph](/images/2015-12-29/p02.jpg)

And here is how it first looks:

![Show line graph](/images/2015-12-29/p03.jpg)

As with the CPU graph, we'd like to adjust the scale and titles.
We again use the `properties` right-click menu to set the temperature
scale:

![Adjust Sys + GPU scales](/images/2015-12-29/p04.jpg)

After adjusting the setting, notice how comparisons between the two graphs are
now much easier:

![Compare scales](/images/2015-12-29/p05.jpg)

And we can now drag and drop our second sensor into the graph:

![Drag second sensor](/images/2015-12-29/p06.jpg)

And there you have it, a nice tab that provides a good summary of important
system temperatures!

![Task complete](/images/2015-12-29/p07.jpg)

You can increase the number of available sensors by installing the lm-sensors
package.  Oh, and there is good news about my laptop:  neither the CPU or the
GPU was exceeding 60C even under heavy load.

As always, I hope you found this useful!

Cheers, Mike

<a id="f1">\*</a> Yes, I know that technically there isn't a "KDE 5 desktop".
For the pendandtic turds in the crowd, I'm running Plasma 5.5 / KDE Frameworks 5.15.0 / KDE applications 5.0.8.  There, happy now?[â†©](#a1)
