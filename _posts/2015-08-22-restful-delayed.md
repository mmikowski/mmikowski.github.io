title: RESTful follow-up coming soon

*Currently designing a Websocket API*

You may have come to this blog looking for a follow-up post about the
challenges with [RESTful APIs](/the_lie/). Don't worry, there will be 
post to enjoy soon enough.  However, I am currently neck-deep 
developing a WebSocket API and I don't have the time to work on that
and the detailed follow-up I had planned for this week.  However, I should
have it available before the end of the month.

Cheers, Mike
