*Why you might benefit from letting a popular paradigm rest in peace.*

### REST is awesome, right?
If you have read an internet developer resume or job posting in the past 10
years, then you might be forgiven if you think that **REST-ful APIs** are gifts
bestowed from the heavens by The One True Web Developer Deity. REST-ful APIs 
are everywhere. Even the marketing folks are pushing them in sales material
intended for CEOs and Human Resources-type folks.

So how good of an idea is REST really?  Before we answer that, let's look at
where REST came from, and what it is.

### Where did REST originate?
REST became popular when it was detailed and promoted by
[Roy Fielding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Fielding)
as part of his doctorial dissertation entitled [Architectural Styles
and the Design of Nework-based Software
Architectures](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm)
in the year 2000.  Roy is well known for his contributions to development of
the web, epecially the HTTP specification.

### What is REST?
[REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) is
Representational State Transfer, an architectural style intended for building
scalable web services. Roy advocated using the request methods he helped define 
in the HTTP standards to impart meaning to HTTP requests. 
Thus the following HTTP requests all have different meanings when using REST:

- `GET /object/list`
- `POST /object/list`
- `PUT /object/list`

There are only a few HTTP request methods.  The full list is `CONNECT`, `DELETE`,
`GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `TRACE`.  You may forgiven if
you've never heard of a few of these, as some are almost never supported by
client or server software.

Roy also advocated that HTTP response codes be used to communicate the meaning
of the response data. There are ~38 HTTP response codes.  Below is a complete list.
I've shortened a few titles in the interest of space:

| Method | Method |
|:----------------------|:-------------------------|
| 200 OK              | 201 Created            |
| 202 Accepted        | 203 Not authorized     |
| 204 No content      | 205 Reset content      |
| 206 Partial content |                        |
| 300 Mult-choice        | 301 Moved permanently  |
| 302 Found              | 303 See other          |
| 304 Not modified       | 306 (unused)           |
| 307 Temporary redirect |                        |
| 400 Bad request             | 401 Unauthorized             |
| 402 Payment required        | 403 Forbidden                |
| 404 Not found               | 405 Method not allowed       |
| 406 Not acceptable          | 407 Proxy auth required      |
| 408 Timeout                 | 409 Conflict                 |
| 410 Gone                    | 411 Length required          |
| 412 Preconditions failed    | 413 Request entity too large |
| 414 Requested URI too long  | 415 Unsupported media        |
| 416 Bad request range       | 417 Expectation failed       |
| 500 Server error    | 501 Not implemented     |
| 502 Bad gateway     | 503 Service unavailable |
| 504 Gateway timeout | 505 Bad HTTP version    |

The meaning of any transaction using REST is therefore the result of
the HTTP request method verb (e.g GET), the request address (e.g. /object/list), 
the request payload (e.g. form fields), the response code (e.g. 202) and 
the response payload (e.g. JSON data).

### REST-ful is actually pretty awful
It's time to break the silence and admit what REST-ful really is: one of the
worst ideas ever widely adopted in web software. Roy is probably a great guy
and he certainly had a lot of great ideas. However, I don't believe that REST was one of them.

We will soon review an approach that is superior archictural style for APIs.  But
before we can fully appreciate the solution, we must first understand the 5 primary
problems with REST and how they accumlate to make creating APIs expensive,
tedious, and error-prone. Let's get started.

### Problem #1: There is little agreement on what REST is
Ever notice how nobody calls their API "REST-pure"?  Instead they
call it "REST-ful" or "REST-ish". That's because nobody can agree on
what all the methods, payloads, and response codes really mean.

Consider, for example, when we might use the `200 OK` response code.
Should we use it to indicate the successful update of a record, or should we
use `201 Created`?  It seems we really should use a code like `250 Updated`
but *that* code doesn't exist.  And can anyone out there explained to me
what `417 Expectation failed` really means?  I mean *besides* Roy?

The vocabulary of HTTP methods and response codes is too vague
and incomplete to get agreement on meanings. No governing body - at least to my
knowledge - has convened to set things straight.  What one company defines as
the meaning of `200 OK` is bound to vary in subtle and annoying ways
from `200 OK` from another company.  Which means a REST-ful
pattern isn't as predictible as we might like.

If this were the only problem, I'd probably be writing REST-ful APIs today.
But the problems keep coming as we shall soon see.

### Problem #2: The REST vocabulary is not fully supported
Even if we could agree on the meaning of the vocabulary of REST,
we run into another practical problem: most client and server applications
don't support all verbs or response codes for the HTTP
protocol.  For example, most web browsers have limited support
`PUT` or `DELETE`. And many server applications often 
don't properly support these methods either.

So how do we work around these application limitations? One common method
with browsers is to embed the *intended* verb into a browser form. Which
means that the REST request now includes:

- an HTTP request method, e.g. `POST`
- a request address, e.g. `/object/list` 
- the *what-we-actually-intended-to-use* request method embedded in
the request payload, e.g. `DELETE`
- and the request payload itself, e.g. form field data.

It gets even worse: different web browsers (and servers) often handle response codes
very differently. For example, if a `307 Temorary redirect` code is
encountered, one browser might allow the client JavaScript to consider the
response *and cancel it* before acting upon it. Another browser might not
allow the client JavaScript to consider the response code at all. 
The only truly reliable response codes across all software are `200 OK` and
`500 Internal server error`.  After that, support varies from *pretty good* 
to *abysmal*.  Because of this, we often see *what-we-actually-intended-to-use*
response codes embedded in the response payload too!

Of course, even if we could get everyone to agree on what REST is, and magically fix all
the not-ready-for-REST software connected to the internet, we'd still have another
problem: the REST vocabulary.

### Problem #3: The REST vocabulary is not rich enough
The REST vocabulary of methods and response codes is simply too
limited to effecively communicate the wide variety of
requests and responses required across all applications.
Imagine we create an application where we want to send a
"render complete" response back to an HTTP client. But we can't do that
using an HTTP response code, because (a) *one doesn't exist* and
(b) *HTTP is not extensible*. Bummer.  I guess we are back to embedding
*what-we-actually-intended-to-use* into the response payload.

There's another problem: we don't have one vocabulary, we have *three*.
HTTP response codes are numbers (200, 201, 202, etc)
that have no direct correlation with HTTP request methods verbs (`GET`,
`POST`, etc). And our payload is typically in JSON. Executing a REST transaction
is like sending a package adressed in Swahilli, with English content, and getting
delivery confirmation in Japanese. This complexity is a great source of confusion
and errors. Which brings us to the next problem: debugging.

### Problem #4: REST is very hard to debug
If you've ever worked with a REST-ful API, you know they are almost impossible
to debug.  That's because you have to look at 7 different locations to piece
together what's happening in a complete transaction:

- The HTTP request method, e.g. `PUT`
- The request address, e.g. `/object/list`
- The *what-we-actually-indended-to-use* request method embedded 
  in the request payload, e.g. `DELETE`
- The "real message" in the request payload, e.g. form data.
- The response code, e.g. `200 OK`
- The *what-we-actually-indended-to-use* response code embedded
  in the response payload, e.g. `201 Created`.
- The "real message" in the response payload

Not only do we have two very limited vocabularies that no one agrees upon or
fully supports, but now we get to look in 7 different places to try to fully
understand and debug a transaction. The only thing that could make this worse
is if REST were completely tied to one protocol and not applicable for any other
communication channel.  That, of course, is our very next problem.

### Problem #5: REST is tied to HTTP and is not portable
REST breaks one of the fundamental laws about good communications:
the message content should be independent of the transmission channel.
Mixing of the two is a time-honored way to confuse our audience.

The intermingling the HTTP protocol with the meaning of the
transactions makes REST-ful APIs completely non-portable.  Moving a
REST-ful API from HTTP to some other transmission method requires disentangling
and restructuring the 7 different locations we use to encode the full meaning of the
transaction.

Happily there is a much better solution that avoids or mitigates almost all
the problems with REST.  We will refer to this solution here as **JSON-pure APIs**.

### The way forward: JSON-pure APIs
**JSON-pure APIs** fix most of the problem we've just discussed.

- They use just one transmission method to send a request - typically `POST`
  for HTTP or a `send` for WebSockets.
- They completely separate the request content from the transmission mechanism.
  All errors, warnings, and data are placed in the JSON request payload.
- They use only one response code to confirm proper receipt of a message -
  typically `200 OK` for HTTP.
- They completely separate the response content from the transmission mechanism.
  All errors, warnings, and data are placed in the JSON response payload.
- They are easy to debug since transaction information is found in easy-to-read
  JSON inside the payloads using a single, domain specific vocabulary.
- They can easily be moved or shared between transmission channels such as
  HTTP/S, WebSockets, XMPP, telnet, SFTP, SCP, or SSH.

JSON-pure APIs came about because web developers found that REST-ful APIs
are not very browser or developer friendly. The separation of message and
transmission channel results in an API that is usually faster, and almost
always more reliable, easier to use, easier to port, and easier to debug.
Today, if you use the Twitter API, for example, masochists can choose the
REST-ful API. The rest of us can use the JSON-pure API (they call it the "Web
API").

I've been asked numerous over the last decade to use a REST-ful API instead of JSON-pure.
The last time I *almost* had to support a REST-ful API was in 2011.
Thankfully, the server team agreed to provide an alternate JSON-pure API along with the 
REST variant by simply stuffing their HTTP methods and response codes into the JSON.
After a few months, everyone I knew who used the API had switched to JSON-pure.
It was just that much better.

### The future of JSON-pure APIs
Stay tuned to this blog for a post detailing how to make a kick-ass JSON-pure API in
the near future.  And remember, when you consider your next API, you might just want to 
make it "REST-less" and "go Pure".
