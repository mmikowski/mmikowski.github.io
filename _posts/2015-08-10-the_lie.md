# REST, the big lie
Why you might benefit from letting an accepted paradigm rest in peace.

### REST is awesome, right?
If you have read an internet developer resume or job posting in the past 10
years, then you might be forgiven if you think that
**REST-ful APIs** have descended from the heavens as a gift from
The One True Web-developer Deity.  REST-ful APIs are everywhere. 
Even the marketing folks are pushing REST as a positive attribute in sales material.

So how good of an idea is REST really?  Before we answer that, let's look at
where REST came from, and what it is.

### Where did REST originate?
REST became popular when it was detailed and promoted by 
[Roy Fielding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Fielding)
as part of his doctorial dissertation entitled [Architectural Styles
and the Design of Nework-based Software
Architectures](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm).
Roy was well known for his contributions to development of the web, epecially
the HTTP specification.

### What is REST?
[REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) is
Representational State Transfer, an architectural style
intended for for building scalable web services.  
Roy advocated using the request methods he helped define in the HTTP standard
to impart meaning to a request.  Thus the following HTTP requests all
would have different meanings: 

- `GET /object/list`
- `POST /object/list`
- `PUT /object/list`

There are only a few HTTP request methods.  The full list is `CONNECT`, `DELETE`,
`GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `TRACE`.  You may forgiven if
you've never heard of a few of these, as some are almost never supported by
browsers or server software.

Roy also advocated that HTTP response codes be used to communicate the meaning
of the response data. There are ~38 HTTP response codes.
Below is complete list. I've shortened a few titles
in the interest of space:

| 200 OK | 201 Created | 202 Accepted |
| 203 Not authoratative | 204 No content | 205 Reset content |
| 206 Partial content | | |

| 300 Mult-choice | 301 Moved permenantly | |
| 302 Found | 303 See other | 304 Not modified |
| 306 (unused) | 307 Temporary redirect | |

| 400 Bad request | 401 Unauthorized | 402 Payment required |
| 403 Forbidden | 404 Not found | 405 Method not allowed |
| 406 Not acceptable | 407 Proxy auth required | 408 Timeout request |
| 409 Conflict | 410 Gone | 411 Length required |
| 412 Preconditions failed | 413 Request entity too large | |
| 414 Request URI too long | | |
| 415 Unsupported media | 416 Bad request range | 417 Expectation failed |

| 500 Server error | 501 Not implemented | 502 Bad gateway |
| 503 Service unavailable | 504 Gateway timeout | 505 Bad HTTP version |

The meaning of any transaction using a REST style is therefore the result of
the HTTP request method verb (e.g GET), the request payload (e.g. the URI string),
the response code (e.g. 202) and the response payload (e.g. a string).

### REST-ful is actually awful
I've worked with REST-ful APIs since they've first emerged, and find 
them one of the worst ideas to ever become common practice in modern web software.
Roy is probably a great guy and he certainly had a lot of great ideas.
However, I don't believe that REST was one of them.

We will soon review an approach that is superior archictural style for APIs.  But
before we can fully appreciate the solution, however, we must undertand the problems of
REST that we need to fix. Below are the 5 major problems that make REST a real
challenge.

### Problem #1: There is little agreement on what REST is
Ever notice how nobody calls their API a "pure-REST" convention?  Instead they
call it "REST-ful." That's because nobody can agree on what all the methods,
payloads, and response codes really mean.

Consider, for example, when we might use the `200 OK` response code.
Should we use it to indicate the successful update of a record, or should we
use `201 Created`?  It seems we really should use a code like `250 Updated`
but *that* code doesn't exist.

The limited vocabulary of HTTP methods and response codes are often to vague
or incomplete to get agreement on their meanings, and (at least to my
knowledge) no governing body has convened to set things straight.  
What one company defines as the meaning of `200 OK` is bound to vary in subtle
and annoying ways from `200 OK` from another company.  Which means a REST-ful
pattern isn't as predictible as we might like.

If this were the only problem, I'd probably have used REST over the past
decade.  But that is only the first problem, and it gets much uglier from
here.  Because even if we could agree on what all the request methods and
response codes, we run into another huge problem: HTTP isn't implemented well
enough to support REST.

### Problem #2: HTTP support for REST is woefully insufficient
Most client and servers don't support all verbs or response codes for the HTTP
protocol.  For example, most web browsers historically have not support PUT or DELETE. 
Even when they do, many back-end frameworks don't support them. 

So how do we work around this limitation? One
common method is to embed the *intended* verb into a browser form.  Which
means that a REST transaction now includes an HTTP verb, a request payload,
**a verb embedded in the payload to be used instead of the actual HTTP verb**,
and a response code.

It gets even worse: different web browsers (and server software) often handle response codes
in very different manners.  For example, if a `307 Temorary redirect` code is
encountered, one browser might allow the client JavaScript to consider this
response *and cancel it* before acting upon it. Another browser might not
allow the JS VM to see the response code at all.  The only truly reliable response codes
across software are `200 OK` and `500 Internal server error`.  After that, it's all
down-hill.

Of course, even if we could get everyone to agree on what REST is, and magically fix all not-ready-for-REST software connected to the we'd still have a yet bigger problem: the REST vocabulary.

### Problem #3: The REST vocabulary is not rich enough
The REST vocabulary of methods and response codes is simply too
limited to express all the types of messages that all types of applications
will need to send. Imagine we created an application where we want to send a
"render complete" response back to an HTTP endpoint. But we can't do that 
using an HTTP response code, because **one doesn't exist** and 
**since HTTP is not extensible** we can't add one.

This too gets worse.  HTTP response codes are numbers (200, 201, 202, etc)
that have no correlation with HTTP request methods, which are verbs.  Yet our
payload is typically in JSON.  So we are using three completely
different vocabularies to communicate a message.  It's like trying to send
package adressed in Swahilli, with English content, and confirmed with a Japanese
receipt.  This complexity is a great source of confusion and errors.  Which
brings us to the next problem.

### Problem #4: REST is awful to debug
If you've ever worked with a REST-ful API, you know they are almost impossible
to debug.  That's because you have to look at 6 different locations to piece
together an entire message transaction: 

- The HTTP request method
- The alternative "this is what we really meant but the client doesn't support it" "HTTP method" poembedded in the request payload
- The "real data" in the request payload
- The response code
- The alternative "this is what we really meant but the client doesn't support
  it" "HTTP response code" embedded in the response payload
- The "real data" in the response payload

Not only do we have two very limited vocabularies that no one agrees upon or
fully supports, but now we have to look in 6 different places to try to fully
understand and debug a transaction?  This is starting to look like a Monty
Python skit.  Of course, the only thing that could make this worse is if REST
were completely tied to one protocol and inapplicable for any other
transmission method.  Which leads us to our next problem.

### Problem #5: REST is tied to HTTP and is not portable
REST breaks one of the fundamental laws about good communication:
the transport medium should be independent of the message.  Certainly 
[Roy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Fielding) had good intentions
when he presented REST as an architecture.  But mixing messages and transport
mechanisms is a time-honored way to confuse those who are communicating.

What's worse, by intermingling the HTTP protocol with the meaning of the
message, it makes REST-ful APIs completely non-portable.  Moving from REST-ful
to some other transmission channel means untangling the 6 different locations
we use to encode the full meaning of a transaction.

Happily there is a much better solution that avoids or mitigates almost all
the problems with REST.  We'll talk about that next!

### The way forward: Web APIs
The best way to avoid the problems with REST-ful APIs is to use a Web API.
A Web API:

- Relies on just one transmission method to send a request - typically `POST`
  for HTTP.
- Completely separates the request message from the transmission mechanism.  All
  errors, warnings, and data are placed in the JSON request payload.
- Rely on only one response code to confirm proper receipt of a message - 
  typically `200 OK` for HTTP.
- Completely separates the response message from the transmission mechanism
  and places all errors, warnings, and data in the JSON response payload.
- Is easy to debug since transaction information is found in easy-to-read
  JSON using a single, domain specific vocabulary.
- Can easily be ported to another transmission protocol such as 
  WebSocket, XMPP, telnet, SFTP, SCP, or SSH.
  
The name Web API came about because web developers found that REST-ful APIs
are not very browser or developer friendly. The separation of message and
transmission resulted in an API delivery style that is usually faster, more reliable,
easier to use, easier to port, and easier to debug. 

### Parting thoughts
I've been challenged numerous times over the last 10 years by the
faithful to use a REST-ful API instead of a Web API. 
The last time I nearly had to support a REST-ful API was in 2011.  Thankfully,
the server team agreed to provide an alternate Web API along side 
the REST-ful API by simply stuffing their *intended* HTTP methods and
response codes into JSON. After a few months, everyone I knew 
had switched to the Web API.
