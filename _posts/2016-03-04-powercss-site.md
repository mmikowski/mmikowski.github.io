![PowerCSS dedicated website][1]

PowerCSS is fast approaching 1.0.x release, and we've launched
a dedicated site, [powercss.org][2]. It is styled with PowerCSS
(what else?) and hase live links to five examples. It also links to 
both the [github][3] and [npm][4] sites.

Check out all the advantages on [powercss.org][2].

Constructive feedback, question, and collaborators are always welcome!

Cheers, Mike
