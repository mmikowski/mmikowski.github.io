## Hi there!
My name is Michael S. Mikowski and I have been an active proponent, architect,
presentor, and author of HTML-native Single Page Web Applications (SPAs) since 2007.  In
fact, you could say I co-wrote [one of the first books](manning.com/mikowski)
on the subject.  Check out the reviews on
[amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Single-Page-Applications-end-end/product-reviews/1617290750).

## Get in touch
Dear anomyous reader, I really care and want to know more about you. However, since I
don't even know your name it's hard for me to pose a first question. If you'd
like to rap, just drop me a line on via one of my numerous contact methods
found [here](michaelmikowski.com)!

## Shameless self-promotion
I currently have a [shameless self-promotion site](michaelmikowski.com) that has lots of 
additional information if you're interested in that sort of thing.
Stuff like recent projects, philosophy, shoe size, etc.
