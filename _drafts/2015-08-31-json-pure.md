### How did we get here?

#### What is this?
This is the follow-up post to [RESTful APIs, the big lie](the_lie).
That article challenged the widely-held belief that RESTful APIs 
provide a robust mechanism for modern web applications.  I wrote that
post in preparation for the API design work that was ahead of me,
and because I had just spent two days recruiting for a new develoment team
and was suprised by how much emphasis the candidates placed on RESTful
APIs without questioning the costs and benefits.

#### Why publish?
Publishing code, presentations, article, books, or blog posts for all
to review is a healthy exercise.  The process of preparing for publication
requires the author to organize his thoughts, otherwise he will be boring,
repetitive, unconvincing - or all three at once (the BRU trifecta). 
The scrutiny after publication is even more valuable, as many perspectives
the author may have never thought of can be considered.  Any claims that
I publish to blog posts or presentations to "drum up" book sales are
almost certainly from those who have never published. 
Trust me, book sales are **not** lucrative for authors. 
But publishing is a great avenue for personal and professional growth.

#### Thanks for all the feedback
I was surprised by the amount an verocity of the interest and feedback post
generated.  Many suggested API design patterns that could resolve many of the
issues that were presented.  Others questioned just about everything I presented.
And I'm greatful for all of it.

Now with all that out of the way, let's talk about **JSON Pure**.

### What is JSON Pure?
A JSON Pure is a name I gave to a best-practice **style** of APIs.
It is **not** a new API protocol designed to supplant all others. 
If you came here for the AngularJS plugin, you will be sadly disappointed.
Many readers undoubtedly already practice many of the suggestions that follow.
While I focus on using JSON here, other encodings such as XML or YAML have
long been used with great success using many of the same principles.


### You gotta keep em separated
The key concept with JSON Pure is to prevent intermingling transport
and application content.  To put it another way, just because a message was
transported to an endpoint doesn't mean that it was properly processed.
RESTful APIs intermingle the transport confirmation ("the message was properly
received") with the application confirmation ("the message was successfuly
used by the application"). This is a key weakness as it is confusing
and can be quite inefficient.

With JSON Pure, intermingling application messages into the transport protocol
is not allowed. We only rely on it to transport the payload to the desired
destination.  If there is a problem, it needs to let us know, and if there isn't, 
we need to know that as well.  All application messages, including all errors, warning,
and confirmations, are communicated through the message payload.

### What are the goals?

### What are RESTful APIs?
[REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) is
Representational State Transfer, an architectural style intended for building
scalable web services. Roy advocated using the request methods he helped define 
in the HTTP standards to impart meaning to HTTP requests.
 
Thus the following HTTP requests all have different meanings when using REST:

- `GET /object/list`
- `POST /object/list`
- `PUT /object/list`

There are only a few HTTP request methods.  The full list is `CONNECT`, `DELETE`,
`GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `PATCH`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `TRACE`.  You may be forgiven if you've never heard of a few of these, as some are almost never supported by
client or server software.

Roy also advocated that HTTP response codes he helped define be used to communicate
the meaning of the response. There are ~38 HTTP response codes.  Below is a complete list. I've shortened a few titles in the interest of space:

| Method | Method |
|:----------------------|:-------------------------|
| 200 OK              | 201 Created            |
| 202 Accepted        | 203 Not authorized     |
| 204 No content      | 205 Reset content      |
| 206 Partial content |                        |
| 300 Multiple choice    | 301 Moved permanently  |
| 302 Found              | 303 See other          |
| 304 Not modified       | 306 (unused)           |
| 307 Temporary redirect |                        |
| 400 Bad request             | 401 Unauthorized             |
| 402 Payment required        | 403 Forbidden                |
| 404 Not found               | 405 Method not allowed       |
| 406 Not acceptable          | 407 Proxy auth required      |
| 408 Timeout                 | 409 Conflict                 |
| 410 Gone                    | 411 Length required          |
| 412 Preconditions failed    | 413 Request entity too large |
| 414 Requested URI too long  | 415 Unsupported media        |
| 416 Bad request range       | 417 Expectation failed       |
| 500 Server error    | 501 Not implemented     |
| 502 Bad gateway     | 503 Service unavailable |
| 504 Gateway timeout | 505 Bad HTTP version    |

The meaning of such an API transaction over HTTP is therefore at the minimum the result of

- the HTTP request method verb, e.g `GET`
- the request address, e.g. `/object/list`
- the request payload, e.g. form fields
- the response code, e.g. `200 OK`, and 
- the response payload, e.g. the JSON data.

Many have embraced this paradigm when providing a web service over HTTP, and this is what we refer to here as a **RESTful API**. 

A RESTful API transaction can be more complex than shown above for various reasons, 
some of which we will discuss below. However, we will ignore the complicating factors associated with network transport and caching since these issues are universal to all communication channels.

### RESTful APIs are actually pretty awful
REST is a great mechanism for many things such as content delivery, and it has served us well for two decades.  But it's time to break the silence and admit that the RESTful API concept is probably one of the worst ideas ever widely adopted in web software. Roy is probably a great guy and he certainly had a lot of great ideas. However, I don't believe that RESTful APIs was one of them.

We will soon review a better way to build internet APIs.  But before we can fully appreciate that solution, we must first understand the 5 primary problems with RESTful APIs that make them expensive, tedious, and error-prone. Let's get started!

### Problem #1: There is little agreement on what a RESTful API is
Ever notice how nobody calls their API "RESTpure"?  Instead they
call it "RESTful" or "RESTish". That's because nobody can agree on
what all the methods, payloads, and response codes really mean.

Consider, for example, when we might use the `200 OK` response code.
Should we use it to indicate the successful update of a record, or should we
use `201 Created`?  It seems we really should use a code like `250 Updated`
but *that* code doesn't exist.  And can anyone out there explained to me
what `417 Expectation failed` really means?  I mean *besides* Roy?

The vocabulary of HTTP methods and response codes is too vague
and incomplete to get agreement on meanings. No governing body - at least to my
knowledge - has convened to set things straight.  What one company defines as
the meaning of `200 OK` is bound to vary in subtle and annoying ways
from `200 OK` from another company.  Which means a RESTful
pattern isn't as predictable as we might like.

If this were the only problem, I'd probably be writing RESTful APIs today.
But the problems keep coming...

### Problem #2: The REST vocabulary is not fully supported
Even if we could agree on the meaning of the vocabulary of REST,
we run into another practical problem: most client and server applications
don't support all verbs or response codes for the HTTP
protocol.  For example, most web browsers have limited support for
`PUT` or `DELETE`. And many server applications often 
don't properly support these methods either.

So how do we work around these application limitations? One common method
developers use with browsers is to embed the *intended* verb into a browser form.
Which means that the REST request now includes:

- an HTTP request method, e.g. `POST`
- a request address, e.g. `/object/list` 
- a *what-we-actually-intended-to-use* request method embedded in
the request payload, e.g. `DELETE`
- and a request payload itself, e.g. form field data.

Response codes aren't handled much better. 
Different web browsers (and servers) often interpret response codes
very differently. For example, if a `307 Temporary redirect` code is
encountered, one browser might allow the client JavaScript to consider the
response *and cancel it* before acting upon it. Another browser might not
allow the client JavaScript to consider the response code at all. 
The only truly reliable response codes across all software are `200 OK` and
`500 Internal server error`.  After that, support varies from *pretty good* 
to *abysmal*.  Because of this, we often see *what-we-actually-intended-to-use*
response codes embedded in the response payload too.

Of course, even if we could get everyone to agree on what REST is, and magically fix all
the not-ready-for-REST software connected to the internet, we'd still have another
problem: the REST vocabulary.

### Problem #3: The REST vocabulary is not rich enough for APIs
The REST vocabulary of methods and response codes is simply too
limited to effectively communicate the wide variety of
requests and responses required across all applications.
Imagine we create an application where we want to send a
"render complete" response back to an HTTP client. But we can't do that
using an HTTP response code, because (a) *one doesn't exist* and
(b) *HTTP is not extensible*. Bummer.  I guess we are back to embedding
*what-we-actually-intended-to-use* into the response payload.

There's another problem: we don't have one vocabulary, we have *three*.
HTTP response codes are numbers (200, 201, 202, etc)
that don't directly correlate with the HTTP request methods (`GET`,
`POST`, etc). And our payload is typically in JSON. Executing a REST transaction
is like sending a package addressed in Swahili, with English content, and getting
delivery confirmation by message drums. This complexity is a great source of confusion
and errors. Which brings us to the next problem: debugging.

### Problem #4: RESTful APIs are very hard to debug
If you've ever worked with a RESTful API, you know they are almost impossible
to debug.  That's because we have to look at 7 different locations to piece
together what's happening in a complete transaction:

- The HTTP request method, e.g. `POST`
- The request address, e.g. `/object/list`
- The *what-we-actually-indended-to-use* request method embedded 
  in the request payload, e.g. `DELETE`
- The "real message" in the request payload, e.g. form data.
- The response code, e.g. `200 OK`
- The *what-we-actually-indended-to-use* response code embedded
  in the response payload, e.g. `206 Partial content`.
- The "real message" in the response payload

Not only do we have two very limited vocabularies that no one agrees upon or
fully supports, but now we get to look in 7 different places to try to fully
understand and debug a transaction. The only thing that could make this worse
is if REST were completely tied to one protocol and not applicable for any other
communication channel.  That, of course, is our very next problem.

### Problem #5: RESTful APIs are usually tied to HTTP
RESTful APIs break one of the fundamental laws about good communications:
the message content should be independent of the transmission channel.
Mixing of the two is a time-honored way to confuse our audience.

The typical intermingling the HTTP protocol of with the meaning of the
transactions makes RESTful APIs completely non-portable.  Moving a
RESTful API from HTTP to some other transmission method requires disentangling
and restructuring information from 7 different locations we use to encode 
the full meaning of RESTful the transactions.

Happily there is a much better solution that avoids or mitigates almost all
the problems with RESTful APIs.  We will refer to this solution here as **JSON-pure APIs**.

### The way forward: JSON-pure APIs
**JSON-pure APIs** fix most of the problem we've just discussed.

- They use just one transmission method to send a request - typically `POST`
  for HTTP or a `send` for WebSockets.
- They completely separate the request content from the transmission mechanism.
  All errors, warnings, and data are placed in the JSON request payload.
- They use only one response code to confirm proper receipt of a message -
  typically `200 OK` for HTTP.
- They completely separate the response content from the transmission mechanism.
  All errors, warnings, and data are placed in the JSON response payload.
- They are easy to debug since transaction information is found in easy-to-read
  JSON inside the payloads using a single, domain specific vocabulary.
- They can easily be moved or shared between transmission channels such as
  HTTP/S, WebSockets, XMPP, telnet, SFTP, SCP, or SSH.

JSON-pure APIs came about because web developers found that RESTful APIs
are not very browser or developer friendly. The separation of message and
transmission channel results in an API that is usually faster, and almost
always more reliable, easier to use, easier to port, and easier to debug.
Today, if you use the Twitter API, for example, masochists can choose the
RESTful API. The rest of us can use the JSON-pure API (they call it the "Web
API").

I've been asked numerous times over the last decade to use a RESTful API instead of JSON-pure. The last time I *almost* had to support a RESTful API was in 2011.
Thankfully, the server team agreed to provide an alternate JSON-pure API along with the RESTful variant by simply stuffing their HTTP methods and response codes into the JSON. After a few months, everyone I knew who used the API had switched to JSON-pure. It was just that much better.

### The future of JSON-pure APIs
Stay tuned to this blog for a post detailing how to make a kick-ass JSON-pure API in the near future.  And remember, when you consider your next API, you might just want to make it "RESTless" and "go Pure".

Cheers, Mike
